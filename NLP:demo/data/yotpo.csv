I would then be stuck using non-natural products (or going no showers) until my new sasquatch was being delivered.  Soapscriptions that problem away!  I splurged for the Deluxe, and my first shipment of 8 bars came in today and it was like Christmas morning!  I officially threw out my back-up non-natural bars knowing that the next shipment will come before I run out.

The picture online makes it look like the soap saver is nearly as big as one of the bars of soap, when in reality it is much smaller.  The picture online shows a three-ridge, square soap saver when the actual soap saver is just a narrow, two-ridge piece of wood.  Also, the picture online shows that the bottom of the soap saver is flat, when in reality it has ridges on both sides.  This makes it difficult for me to place it on the wire mesh shower caddy I had planned on using it on as the ridges go through the wire.

Also, while the soap does smell wonderful, the sharp scent of spearmint lasted only as long as the first shower. The basil scent lasted only a day or two longer. Both can still be smelled if one holds the soap to one's nose, but the bar and the lather really only have a vague, though pleasant, floral scent.

The fact that the dish is made of cedar wood keeps my shower smelling pleasant and refreshing when it steams up. it also keeps the flies out. And the termites. They buzz right off. The two complaints I have about the dish aren't a huge problem to me, but do keep it from being a five star knockout product. Whether it's the soap or the dish, all of my Dr. Squatch brand soaps (Pine Tar, Bay Rum, and Cedar Citrus) have a tendency to stick to the dish. It takes a bit to unstick the soaps, and occasionally I mar the bar. This next issue may be an issue of newness, but the dish tends to secrete a dark oil when it starts absorbing moisture. The oil hasn't stained anything, but it does discolor the soap and get all over the shower.

Wow. 
 
I was pretty excited that the Gold Moss scrub left essentially no film. That was what drove me away from bar soap to begin with. 
 
Also, the smell. While not overpowering, I find myself walking around daily with the faint aroma of what I could only describe as 'the woods'. I no longer smell like a boring white guy...I smell like a man of the wilderness. 
 
The only issue I had with the process was that the soap actually made it into my city 5 days before it was delivered. I assume this is due to the transfer from UPS to USPS. But once I received the soap, there were no complaints to be had.",5,2014-12-10 04:00:00 UTC,109191402,http://drsquatch.com/products/gold-moss-scrub,Gold Moss Scrub,"Scent Description:

3179009,verified_buyer,rovsuhtR01AOZ8Vl90zCBkGot9h5DML2IsoJ9tn3,true,"Not quite Gold Moss, but still great.","Don't let the label of ""cologne"" fool you, this is something totally different than what you are used to. Where boutique colognes tend to be complex and wildly unique, Driftwood is very blunt and somehow gently in-your-face. This is a scent for a simple sort of man who wants his admirers to feel like they are relaxing in a classic American log cabin instead of in a boardroom full of European suits. 
 
The bottle is small, but the scent in the oil is so strong that you don't need but a drop to rub between wrists and on neck to be surrounded in a cloud of warm, citrusy wilderness with a hint of spice. I would describe the scent as sandalwood and spicey grapefruit, with the strong presence of the sandalwood giving way to the grapefruit as time goes on. The strength of the scent seems to wane after 4 or so hours, but it doesn't completely go away for much longer. Basically par for the course with other colognes, though I'm applying a fraction of what I would have to apply with my old Armani to get this presence of scent. 
 
I like that it's all natural oils. I like that I don't smell like a frat boy or a french businessman. Use at your own risk, you may find older women start to call you ""daddy"" once this is applied.",5,2015-01-02 04:00:00 UTC,384842892,http://drsquatch.com/products/driftwood-all-natural-cologne,Driftwood,"Scent Description:

Plenty of other reviews have gone on at length about the intensity of the pine tar. The pine scent is crazy-potent and the exfoliants are like 20 grit sand paper and crushed glass. Great if you need to take off a year of grime and dead skin. Otherwise? It might be more than you need. This might not sound like a glowing review, but the fact is? Coarseness aside? I like the bar. I was just a bit surprised to see how rapidly it diminished. somewhere around 8 - 10 showers in, it was a thin shadow of its former self. Coming from a different brand of hand-cut soap sold in 3.5 oz cubes that survived a month+ in my shower? I guess I expected more from the larger Dr. Squatch bar. Seems like the oatmeal and sand combine to make the bar less dense, so it just goes a lot faster. As for the Bay Rum? I just switched over to it. Love this scent (as does my wife - much more so than the Pine Tar). In fact, I like it enough so sign up for a subscription.

6427213,verified_buyer,rovsuhtR01AOZ8Vl90zCBkGot9h5DML2IsoJ9tn3,true,Pine Tar & Gold Moss,"The descriptions of these soaps are definitely accurate. Pine Tar is a strong woodsy scent. As far as the oatmeal in the bar goes, it's a huge plus. I have some skin problems and the benefits of this soap were almost immediate. When the bar began to run out I bought another and also picked up the Gold Moss to try out. This bar and it's scent is totally different, but equally great. There's really nothing quite like it, whereas the Pine Tar smells like a fresh cut tree. 

What I really enjoy about both of these bars and any soap from Dr. Squatch is the lack of chemicals. My skin is a lot less itchy and irritated. I've also been able to replace my shampoo with this soap. It definitely does the job without making my hair practically fall out. In just a month it grew back about 3x more than before. I've had this stuff in my eyes too and you can't even feel it. 

Overall the smell is good and long-lasting, the things it does for you skin and hair is incredible, and at $6 it's totally worth it. Chances are if your girlfriend is like mine she'll love it too, and with the leftover sliver of Pine Tar I had left the dog got a good bath with it. 

As a guy living in the Pacific Northwest that spends most of his time in the woods and sand dunes and racing ATV's, I'd say this soap lives up to what it claims and exceeds expectations. There's no reason not to take good care of yourself and smell awesome, and this soap will get you there.",5,2015-05-08 04:00:00 UTC,yotpo_site_reviews,http://drsquatch.com,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"",,Austin R.,bwrproductions@gmail.com,,,,,,

I have to say that the soaps are great. I use it primarily on my beard and occasionally on my body. I never feel dried out or covered in a film. I wash my beard at least once a day, and Dr. Squatch soaps help keep it from feeling like hay. The base soap of both scents I have used has been great; I would give the soap five stars. I cannot say the same about the scents.

I would not say Deep Sea Goat's Milk is an earthy men's fragrance. It is very floral. What I pick up most is something along the lines of lavender. This is not to say that men cannot enjoy floral scents; it is 2015, and everyone knows anyone can enjoy whatever they want.

While the description of the scent here says, ""Earthy and Creamy"", I only get a flowery aroma. It is similar to my grandmother's potpourri or a free perfume sample you might get in a Kohl's catalog. Not great and not what I was expecting.

Cedar citrus is an interesting scent and one that I enjoy. It has a muted and well-rounded orange smell, but the base aroma is that of sweet, damp wood.

I've only been able to use the Pine tar soap, but in combination with either colognes, well ladies and gents, it is a doozy. I'm being smelled at the office, at parties, being passed around getting hugged since people are so curious at what permeates from my body. Like I read when I first was investigating the good Dr, look good feel good, and that starts from the skin up. I've used so many different body soaps (both bar and liquid) over the years and was still plagued with dry irritated skin. Not anymore. And since it's so kickass anyways I use it as shampoo and face wash....and my skin or hair have never felt better. No more dry skin. It feels softer and healthier. So the only real comment I have, oh Squatchers, is when will you come out with a deodorant? 
I enjoy changing scents on a daily basis and since it's oil based it seems to stay on longer than most all the other colognes I've spent too much money on.

There was a great old barn-turned-rec-center at a summer camp I attended and later worked at. The wood in that building was sealed with pine tar. I never knew what that classic scent was until I caught a whiff of this soap and was taken right back to some of the best summers of my life. I'm NOT saying you'll smell like an old barn if you use Pine Tar--this soap has a wonderfully refreshing, pungently sweet, but not overpowering scent. I am saying this soap packs an aromatic punch that evokes good ol' times of summers playing in the forest and spent at camp. Since the cigar/gift box arrived from Dr. Squatch, I've looked forward to hitting the shower each morning and really waking up with this ruggedly invigorating soap. It not only serves its primary purpose well--lathering up and cleaning great; it's also provides a (welcomed!) daily dose of thoroughly manly aromatherapy. There's a reason this is their best-seller; it's a classic.

She looked at the ingredients used and was on board. I still was in my head, not going to be convinced. But then my order arrived and the smell alone was phenomenal!

I took the “Prescription Quiz” and read reviews for the different soaps and colognes. I realized the Deluxe Gift Box was the most economical way to sample it all. Even so, initially I was reluctant to make the investment in this collection of products I’d only seen advertised online. Let me tell you, I AM SO GLAD I DID! The quality of the soaps, the fragrance, and the cigar box far exceeded my expectations. I’ve previously reviewed the Pine Tar soap and Hemlock Trail cologne—both are classic, invigorating, masculine products!—and I’m looking forward to lathering up with the Gold Moss, Bay Rum, and Cool Fresh Aloe soaps that also arrived in the Deluxe Gift Box. (I’ll review them when I get to them—but these bars last a LONG time, which is awesome!) I want to comment here, though, on the box itself, because it’s what raises this from merely a set of outstanding personal care products to the kind of classy, timeless, souvenir that you could give to your groomsmen before a wedding, to your son at a milestone in his young adulthood, or to a father-figure in your life on a very special occasion. Mine arrived in an Alec Bradley Black Market (Toro) cigar box. Solid wood, the box was handmade in Honduras, features an antique-looking metal latch, and is decorated on the inside with faded, Old World-style shipping receipts. Opening the box feels like stepping back in time…, which kind of makes sense when you consider that everything Dr. Squatch makes is handcrafted using natural ingredients and traditional processes. Like everyone else, I enjoy my modern conveniences, but there’s something essential about touching, opening, and breathing in that which is authentic, grounded, and connected to ways of doing things and being in the world that are genuine, time-honored, and altogether worth remembering.",5,2015-08-02 04:00:00 UTC,389049520,http://drsquatch.com/products/deluxe-gift-box-save-15,Deluxe Gift Box,"Product Description:

I will say I like the smell. and the scent it leaves on you after a shower. and yes, it does leave a good scent in the bathroom as well. I will say the bar only lasted me a week. That is something I wanted to find out about, and my only negative thing to say about it. But after a week of using it, I did notice a difference in how my skin feels, and also how it seems to get rid of the ""old man smell"" I think I can now associate with using regular commercial brand bar soap, and the film it leaves on you. I have in the past used a hard mill natural soap before, and liked the way it lasted longer than regular soap. I started using the gold moss scrub tonight, and it has a great smell to it too. I will see how long it will last me, I hope longer than the pine tar, which I think I go through quick because I shower daily, and the exfoliants may make it more porous, but you do get a good scrubbing from it. Ask me in a week or two and I will give you my opinion of the Gold Moss. Now for the rest of my review, I will say this. I deal with people a lot, and I notice a lot of repetition of smells from guys, same type of smell, which seems to me to be overpowering, and I would say metrosexual feminine with no character. So far, I like the unique clean fragrance that doesn't smell like everybody else, and it's far from the overwhelming garbage I smell out there, these guys may as well be wearing tussy lol!

I had to try it, right away. Me and my wife were arguing lightly about something ridiculous before I hit the shower, when I got out she came in and the smell stopped the argument. She said how much she liked it, even better than the Gold Moss, which was my personal favorite before. I have a full beard,and it softens it and detangles.it doesn't have the long lasting scent I thought it would, at least that I can tell,but it definitely does a great job as far as a beard soap goes.

Natural, oil based, colognes like these typically won&#x27;t last as long as your typical alcohol based ones.

9382325,anonymous,rovsuhtR01AOZ8Vl90zCBkGot9h5DML2IsoJ9tn3,false,"Difficult to load, but overall great!","Dr Squatch's Shave Bar is a unique smelling soap with a great masculine scent of clay, mint and a very nice citrus hint at the end that stays with you after the shave.

During the time of this shave I had two weeks facial hair growth, a new Persona blade in a Phoenix DOC Safety Razor.

I do have to say at the beginning using this soap while blooming it I was almost about to give up, there is a certain way that this soap needs to be lathered. If you fail to lather it in the way that it is designed to you will be very disappointed in the results.

This soap is a very hard soap to lather if you do not know what you are doing. If are used to a wet brush and blooming your soap this soap will cause you to change your habits. This soap does not like excess water, if you use too much water you will be very disappointed to see the result, that result being a foamy lather. When the soap is applied onto the face correctly with minimal water you are going to have to hydrate the soap roughly 45 seconds to a minute in order to keep it as a cream, if you choose not to it will dry out on your face. I also noticed that this soap works better with a smaller boar size brush due to the size of the puck being 4.5 oz. My best result was with an Omega 46065 boar brush with a face lather. I also tried with a 30mm knot Whipped Dog High Mountain Badger brush and a Esccali badger brush, the soap worked great in both a face and bowl lather although I would recommend a bowl lather as it is a lot easier to see the reaction of the soap and add water.

When this soap is loaded correctly the soap is a great soap, with a strong masculine smell and glide that it supplies could be a soap I would turn to on a regular shaving basis. I would be reluctant to use this soap while shaving a longer growth just because of how much attention has to be applied to the consistency of the soap, if there is too much or too less water you will not enjoy the shave. I would not recommend this soap for newcomers to the art of traditional shaving just because of all the factors that come into play. Price of this soap is 12$ for 4.5 ounces that puts the cost as 2.66$ per ounce which is beyond fair in my eyes.

Loading ability of this soap is going to be lower due to just how picky it is for this soap to form a good lather. I will give it a 4 out of 10.

Peaks with this soap are very nice and deserve nothing less than a 8 out of 10.

Gliding ability with this soap is a 7 out of 10.

Scent of this soap would receive a 9 out of 10.

Overall this soap would receive a 7 out of 10.

Of course I always would recommend a good pre-shave to help with the gliding ability.",4,2015-10-07 04:00:00 UTC,946521860,http://drsquatch.com/products/shave-bar,Shave Bar,"Description:

9954706,verified_buyer,rovsuhtR01AOZ8Vl90zCBkGot9h5DML2IsoJ9tn3,false,Soaps I have tried so far;,"The Bay Rum is my favorite I believe. I really like the smell and so does my wife. She didn't care for the Gold Moss. Using the Bay Rum reminds me of my childhood and getting Old Spice or one of those type products from my old fashioned Great Aunt. I know it sounds corny, but using this soap reminds me of a past when things were more ""manly"". It is a man's type smell and the soap just works so much better for showering than the other commercial made soaps. I used to use Lever 2000, but won't buy any of those again. Dr. Squatch is a superior product to any of the name brand soaps purchased in stores. You step out of the shower feeling good and clean and you smell like a man should. 
My next favorite and very close second is the Pine Tar. I didn't know what to think when I saw the black color but immediately enjoyed the smell and the coarse texture. It is a great soap. I may have to keep two bars in the shower at a time and switch back and forth. The Pine smell is great! Reminds you of the outdoors. (I have an outdoor shower too). The coarse texture reminds me of the old Lava brand soap my father used to keep out on the utility room sink for washing dirty hands. Great scrubbing ability, (we won't use the exfoliation word) or any other feminine terminology. The Pine Tar really cleans well and leaves you feeling fresh when you finish your shower. Awesome product! 
Using the Goats Milk, Sea salt now. I'll fill you in later. I used to have Dairy goats and my wife made a milk soap and would add ground up egg shells for texture, so I'm interested to try your sea salt version.

I'm past 50 now and as far from hip as I can be. I worry about things like death and taxes. But I like to smell good too. I relented and picked up a couple bars. The Pine Tar was up first, and it blew me away. The smell reminded me of my old trout fishing cabin from my youth. Once my reminiscences of a #18 Olive Dun subsided, I realized how fresh and non-filmy I felt. My wife greeted me at the bathroom door (THAT never happens) and said, ""You smell good."" She's smelled me plenty of other ways without commenting, so that was a bit miraculous on it's own. She rubbed my arm and said, ""And you're soft too."" Since my kids might end up reading this, I'll dispense with further annotations.

I thought I'd give the soap a generous try before commenting. It does have some moisturizers. It leaves a very light scent if any at all. It's not a long lasting scent. ""Scrub"" is not a characteristic I would have included in the product description.

Also, while the soap does smell wonderful, the sharp scent of spearmint lasted only as long as the first shower. The basil scent lasted only a day or two longer. Both can still be smelled if one holds the soap to one's nose, but the bar and the lather really only have a vague, though pleasant, floral scent.

The fact that the dish is made of cedar wood keeps my shower smelling pleasant and refreshing when it steams up. it also keeps the flies out. And the termites. They buzz right off. The two complaints I have about the dish aren't a huge problem to me, but do keep it from being a five star knockout product. Whether it's the soap or the dish, all of my Dr. Squatch brand soaps (Pine Tar, Bay Rum, and Cedar Citrus) have a tendency to stick to the dish. It takes a bit to unstick the soaps, and occasionally I mar the bar. This next issue may be an issue of newness, but the dish tends to secrete a dark oil when it starts absorbing moisture.

At first it seemed a little rough, rubbing the bar on my bare skin felt like dragging heavenly 100-grit sandpaper all over my body. Naturally I wasn't in the shower alone, and my girlfriend decided to try out Pine Tar as well, she winced ""ouch! It hurts!"" When I read that this soap was ""exfoliating"" I felt that it was a little foo-foo, so let me re-phrase that claim. This soap (in one session) removed the accumulated blood, sweat, automotive grease, and grime from my latest differential re-build, bringing my skin down to its natural form. It was invigorating. Also, the smell. After one shower my one bedroom apartment took on the glorious smell of a carpentry shop. I will be ordering Pine Tar again. I still have five more soaps to try out, but I'm not sure anything can compare.",5,2014-12-30 04:00:00 UTC,yotpo_site_reviews,http://drsquatch.com,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"",,Joseph A.,enddescency@gmail.com,,,,,,

Each fragrance is distinct, balanced and clean- I am hard-pressed to find even one I dislike in the slightest.

32098351,verified_buyer,rovsuhtR01AOZ8Vl90zCBkGot9h5DML2IsoJ9tn3,true,"Not quite Gold Moss, but still great.","Don't let the label of ""cologne"" fool you, this is something totally different than what you are used to. Where boutique colognes tend to be complex and wildly unique, Driftwood is very blunt and somehow gently in-your-face. This is a scent for a simple sort of man who wants his admirers to feel like they are relaxing in a classic American log cabin instead of in a boardroom full of European suits. 
 
The bottle is small, but the scent in the oil is so strong that you don't need but a drop to rub between wrists and on neck to be surrounded in a cloud of warm, citrusy wilderness with a hint of spice. I would describe the scent as sandalwood and spicey grapefruit, with the strong presence of the sandalwood giving way to the grapefruit as time goes on. The strength of the scent seems to wane after 4 or so hours, but it doesn't completely go away for much longer. Basically par for the course with other colognes, though I'm applying a fraction of what I would have to apply with my old Armani to get this presence of scent. 
 
I like that it's all natural oils. I like that I don't smell like a frat boy or a french businessman.

Plenty of other reviews have gone on at length about the intensity of the pine tar. The pine scent is crazy-potent and the exfoliants are like 20 grit sand paper and crushed glass. Great if you need to take off a year of grime and dead skin. Otherwise? It might be more than you need. This might not sound like a glowing review, but the fact is? Coarseness aside? I like the bar. I was just a bit surprised to see how rapidly it diminished. somewhere around 8 - 10 showers in, it was a thin shadow of its former self. Coming from a different brand of hand-cut soap sold in 3.5 oz cubes that survived a month+ in my shower? I guess I expected more from the larger Dr. Squatch bar. Seems like the oatmeal and sand combine to make the bar less dense, so it just goes a lot faster. As for the Bay Rum? I just switched over to it. Love this scent (as does my wife - much more so than the Pine Tar). In fact, I like it enough so sign up for a subscription.

The smell is great, but almost non-existent after about half an hour. I also love the marketing strategy and the all-natural, manly, wilderness vibe of the brand. The soap itself, however, seems to be withering away rather quickly and I haven't quite had it a week (and no, I don't bathe extremely frequently). I just wish the soap, and the smell, lasted as long as other similar products I've used. Maybe it's just the Gold Moss Scrub, but I figured the ""Most Popular Scent"" was a good first bet. Overall, I still love the soap.

32098893,verified_buyer,rovsuhtR01AOZ8Vl90zCBkGot9h5DML2IsoJ9tn3,true,Pine Tar & Gold Moss,"The descriptions of these soaps are definitely accurate. Pine Tar is a strong woodsy scent. As far as the oatmeal in the bar goes, it's a huge plus. I have some skin problems and the benefits of this soap were almost immediate. When the bar began to run out I bought another and also picked up the Gold Moss to try out. This bar and it's scent is totally different, but equally great. There's really nothing quite like it, whereas the Pine Tar smells like a fresh cut tree. 

What I really enjoy about both of these bars and any soap from Dr. Squatch is the lack of chemicals. My skin is a lot less itchy and irritated. I've also been able to replace my shampoo with this soap. It definitely does the job without making my hair practically fall out. In just a month it grew back about 3x more than before. I've had this stuff in my eyes too and you can't even feel it. 

Overall the smell is good and long-lasting, the things it does for you skin and hair is incredible, and at $6 it's totally worth it. Chances are if your girlfriend is like mine she'll love it too, and with the leftover sliver of Pine Tar I had left the dog got a good bath with it. 

As a guy living in the Pacific Northwest that spends most of his time in the woods and sand dunes and racing ATV's, I'd say this soap lives up to what it claims and exceeds expectations.

They are a great weekend scent that is not over powering and is reminiscent of the out doors. The descriptions on the website pretty accurately describe what you are getting. If you are on the fence try the sampler, more than worth it. All in all I'm thoroughly enjoying my soapscription and cologne. High quality products!

I have to say that the soaps are great. I use it primarily on my beard and occasionally on my body. I never feel dried out or covered in a film. I wash my beard at least once a day, and Dr. Squatch soaps help keep it from feeling like hay. The base soap of both scents I have used has been great; I would give the soap five stars. I cannot say the same about the scents.

I would not say Deep Sea Goat's Milk is an earthy men's fragrance. It is very floral. What I pick up most is something along the lines of lavender. This is not to say that men cannot enjoy floral scents; it is 2015, and everyone knows anyone can enjoy whatever they want.

While the description of the scent here says, ""Earthy and Creamy"", I only get a flowery aroma. It is similar to my grandmother's potpourri or a free perfume sample you might get in a Kohl's catalog. Not great and not what I was expecting.

32099143,verified_buyer,rovsuhtR01AOZ8Vl90zCBkGot9h5DML2IsoJ9tn3,true,Dear Dr Squatch,"Well my dear Squatchers in Squatchland.....you have made me into the squatchman I was always supposed to be. I've only been able to use the Pine tar soap, but in combination with either colognes, well ladies and gents, it is a doozy. I'm being smelled at the office, at parties, being passed around getting hugged since people are so curious at what permeates from my body. Like I read when I first was investigating the good Dr, look good feel good, and that starts from the skin up. I've used so many different body soaps (both bar and liquid) over the years and was still plagued with dry irritated skin. Not anymore. And since it's so kickass anyways I use it as shampoo and face wash....and my skin or hair have never felt better. No more dry skin. It feels softer and healthier. So the only real comment I have, oh Squatchers, is when will you come out with a deodorant? 
I enjoy changing scents on a daily basis and since it's oil based it seems to stay on longer than most all the other colognes I've spent too much money on. 
Ya'll have a Squatcher for life. Good work and PLEASE keep it up.

I never knew what that classic scent was until I caught a whiff of this soap and was taken right back to some of the best summers of my life. I'm NOT saying you'll smell like an old barn if you use Pine Tar--this soap has a wonderfully refreshing, pungently sweet, but not overpowering scent. I am saying this soap packs an aromatic punch that evokes good ol' times of summers playing in the forest and spent at camp. Since the cigar/gift box arrived from Dr. Squatch, I've looked forward to hitting the shower each morning and really waking up with this ruggedly invigorating soap. It not only serves its primary purpose well--lathering up and cleaning great; it's also provides a (welcomed!) daily dose of thoroughly manly aromatherapy. There's a reason this is their best-seller; it's a classic.

Mine arrived in an Alec Bradley Black Market (Toro) cigar box. Solid wood, the box was handmade in Honduras, features an antique-looking metal latch, and is decorated on the inside with faded, Old World-style shipping receipts. Opening the box feels like stepping back in time €¦, which kind of makes sense when you consider that everything Dr. Squatch makes is handcrafted using natural ingredients and traditional processes.

I will say I like the smell. and the scent it leaves on you after a shower. and yes, it does leave a good scent in the bathroom as well. I will say the bar only lasted me a week. That is something I wanted to find out about, and my only negative thing to say about it. But after a week of using it, I did notice a difference in how my skin feels, and also how it seems to get rid of the ""old man smell"" I think I can now associate with using regular commercial brand bar soap, and the film it leaves on you. I have in the past used a hard mill natural soap before, and liked the way it lasted longer than regular soap. I started using the gold moss scrub tonight, and it has a great smell to it too. I will see how long it will last me, I hope longer than the pine tar, which I think I go through quick because I shower daily, and the exfoliants may make it more porous, but you do get a good scrubbing from it. Ask me in a week or two and I will give you my opinion of the Gold Moss. Now for the rest of my review, I will say this. I deal with people a lot, and I notice a lot of repetition of smells from guys, same type of smell, which seems to me to be overpowering, and I would say metrosexual feminine with no character. So far, I like the unique clean fragrance that doesn't smell like everybody else, and it's far from the overwhelming garbage I smell out there, these guys may as well be wearing tussy lol!

When I opened the mailbox, the smell hit me like a truck. It was very strong pine almost like pine sol. Once I opened it up I realized this was definitely some powerful stuff. I had to try it, right away. Me and my wife were arguing lightly about something ridiculous before I hit the shower, when I got out she came in and the smell stopped the argument. She said how much she liked it, even better than the Gold Moss, which was my personal favorite before. I have a full beard,and it softens it and detangles.it doesn't have the long lasting scent I thought it would, at least that I can tell,but it definitely does a great job as far as a beard soap goes. I would recommend this soap to anyone with a longer beard, or who loves the pleasent refreshing smell of pine tar. It does leave a lot of black in the shower, but it rinses right away.

This one, though, is rated as a ""medium."" Out of the package and when it's in use, the bar smells great. But once I'm done with the shower, I can't smell it at all. Granted, I don't smell like fumunda cheese and onions so I guess it's doing the job of cleaning, but there's no lingering scent at all. I expected the scent to be stronger than that of the Gold Moss and was surprised to find that it's basically non-existent.

32099615,anonymous,rovsuhtR01AOZ8Vl90zCBkGot9h5DML2IsoJ9tn3,false,"Difficult to load, but overall great!","Dr Squatch's Shave Bar is a unique smelling soap with a great masculine scent of clay, mint and a very nice citrus hint at the end that stays with you after the shave.

During the time of this shave I had two weeks facial hair growth, a new Persona blade in a Phoenix DOC Safety Razor.

I do have to say at the beginning using this soap while blooming it I was almost about to give up, there is a certain way that this soap needs to be lathered. If you fail to lather it in the way that it is designed to you will be very disappointed in the results.

This soap is a very hard soap to lather if you do not know what you are doing. If are used to a wet brush and blooming your soap this soap will cause you to change your habits. This soap does not like excess water, if you use too much water you will be very disappointed to see the result, that result being a foamy lather. When the soap is applied onto the face correctly with minimal water you are going to have to hydrate the soap roughly 45 seconds to a minute in order to keep it as a cream, if you choose not to it will dry out on your face. I also noticed that this soap works better with a smaller boar size brush due to the size of the puck being 4.5 oz. My best result was with an Omega 46065 boar brush with a face lather. I also tried with a 30mm knot Whipped Dog High Mountain Badger brush and a Esccali badger brush, the soap worked great in both a face and bowl lather although I would recommend a bowl lather as it is a lot easier to see the reaction of the soap and add water.

When this soap is loaded correctly the soap is a great soap, with a strong masculine smell and glide that it supplies could be a soap I would turn to on a regular shaving basis. I would be reluctant to use this soap while shaving a longer growth just because of how much attention has to be applied to the consistency of the soap, if there is too much or too less water you will not enjoy the shave. I would not recommend this soap for newcomers to the art of traditional shaving just because of all the factors that come into play. Price of this soap is 12$ for 4.5 ounces that puts the cost as 2.66$ per ounce which is beyond fair in my eyes.

Loading ability of this soap is going to be lower due to just how picky it is for this soap to form a good lather. I will give it a 4 out of 10.

Peaks with this soap are very nice and deserve nothing less than a 8 out of 10.

Gliding ability with this soap is a 7 out of 10.

Scent of this soap would receive a 9 out of 10.

Overall this soap would receive a 7 out of 10.

Of course I always would recommend a good pre-shave to help with the gliding ability.",4,2015-10-07 04:00:00 UTC,83120728,https://drsquatch.com/,Shave Bar,Raise the Bar on Shaving,http://s3.amazonaws.com/yotpo-images-production/Product/16646076/12250703/thumb.png,Mike,polskaman94@yahoo.com,,,,,,

Dr. Squatch cleared everything up in about 5 days. The grit is just right to rough up the skin and exfoliate, without being painful or abrasive. I hate to follow up such a positive 5 star review with a complaint, but the size is just too small for the price. The one bar lasted me less than 3 weeks. It's possible that I did indulge as I used it to scrub my face and (hairless) head every day too, but even if I could get a full month out of a bar, $9 is a bit too much as a monthly expense for soap.

The Pine Tar is fantastic, a bit scratchy though. It does leave a residue wherever it sits. 
 
Use a soap saver, as well as a loofah (man up and stop complaining you go through soap too fast when you have easy options like this! dark green and blue ones are a couple bucks at Walmart) to extend the life of this bar, since it is only 5 oz

32099705,verified_buyer,rovsuhtR01AOZ8Vl90zCBkGot9h5DML2IsoJ9tn3,false,Soaps I have tried so far;,"The Bay Rum is my favorite I believe. I really like the smell and so does my wife. She didn't care for the Gold Moss. Using the Bay Rum reminds me of my childhood and getting Old Spice or one of those type products from my old fashioned Great Aunt. I know it sounds corny, but using this soap reminds me of a past when things were more ""manly"". It is a man's type smell and the soap just works so much better for showering than the other commercial made soaps. I used to use Lever 2000, but won't buy any of those again. Dr. Squatch is a superior product to any of the name brand soaps purchased in stores. You step out of the shower feeling good and clean and you smell like a man should. 
My next favorite and very close second is the Pine Tar. I didn't know what to think when I saw the black color but immediately enjoyed the smell and the coarse texture. It is a great soap. I may have to keep two bars in the shower at a time and switch back and forth. The Pine smell is great! Reminds you of the outdoors. (I have an outdoor shower too). The coarse texture reminds me of the old Lava brand soap my father used to keep out on the utility room sink for washing dirty hands. Great scrubbing ability, (we won't use the exfoliation word) or any other feminine terminology. The Pine Tar really cleans well and leaves you feeling fresh when you finish your shower. Awesome product! 
Using the Goats Milk, Sea salt now. I'll fill you in later. I used to have Dairy goats and my wife made a milk soap and would add ground up egg shells for texture, so I'm interested to try your sea salt version.

I'm past 50 now and as far from hip as I can be. I worry about things like death and taxes. But I like to smell good too. I relented and picked up a couple bars. The Pine Tar was up first, and it blew me away. The smell reminded me of my old trout fishing cabin from my youth. Once my reminiscences of a #18 Olive Dun subsided, I realized how fresh and non-filmy I felt. My wife greeted me at the bathroom door (THAT never happens) and said, ""You smell good."" She's smelled me plenty of other ways without commenting, so that was a bit miraculous on it's own. She rubbed my arm and said, ""And you're soft too.""

Long story short, the soap doesn't stick whatsoever! However, when you read the description and see that this is crafted from California cedar, you get this image of a wooden brick that can look at home in a forest - pretty manly image, right?

Well, this thing feels like it's made of balsa wood. If it had a little more heft, it might command the $15 price tag. If mine didn't come in the sampler, I'd be ticked for spending that much for something that feels so 'limp.'

I typically avoid things such as bar soaps or anything with exfoliating qualities, and opt for more soothing, gentler cleansers. I was lucky enough to work with the Dr. Squatch team on a project and they were kind enough to send a bar of the Pine Tar soap home with me. I must have been feeling particularly adventurous that evening, and gave the somewhat masculine scented, exfoliating, bar soap a try in the shower- and boy oh boy, my skin thanked me. The natural exfoliation helped eliminate a lot of the dryness from my psoriasis and the natural qualities of the soap had an immediate soothing effect. After a few days of using this product, I could see a noticeable improvement in the appearance and feel of my psoriasis, and my skin felt softer and healthier overall. I've spent thousands of dollars looking for prescription and natural products that would give even the slightest improvement to my psoriasis, and this is one of the best I've found yet!

I saw Dr. Squatch pop up on my Facebook page numerous times, and on about the 100th time, I decided to look at the web site. I became a ""6-Bar a-Quarter"" Soapscriber, to save money. The last soap I chose for my soapscription this quarter was the Deep Sea Goats Milk. And, wouldn't you know it, it was the one my girlfriend think smelled the best, saying, ""It smells like how a man is supposed to smell."" I actually blindfolded her and did a scent type playoffs with the soaps, with the playoff brackets included, and the Goats Mike won. In my opinion, I like the smell of all 6 I received this time. They're all unique. I've used this bar about 2-1/2 weeks now, and it should be gone by the end of this week. I read on the site that you can even use the Goats Milk soap to wash your hair and beard, so that's exactly what I did.

When I first tried it I was not sold immediately, yet it has grown on me and now we keep this one by the kitchen sink. It works perfectly there. Clary sage and lavender go very well together; this reminds me of Schmidt's natural deodorant scent Lavender and Sage with a more masculine aroma. I don't smell the cypress too strongly, but I know its in there. Sea salt is always great and contributes to making hands feel more nourished, hence why we like having it near the sink to offset harsh dish ""soaps.""

33213648,anonymous,rovsuhtR01AOZ8Vl90zCBkGot9h5DML2IsoJ9tn3,true,I feel like I'm using actual soap for the first time in my life.,"A truly wonderful product. I hope Dr. Squatch continues to grow without compromising this soap because it is a game-changer for me. I've always suffered from acne concentrated solely on my chest. Rarely on the face or back, but my chest would always break out no matter what I did. Well I've used the Pine Tar soap bar for 9 days. I don't have any new blemishes, and the ones I had are all slowly becoming smaller, less red, and less irritated. A couple are completely gone.

The soap itself is a pleasure to use. The oatmeal feels like you're getting a massage. The scent is fantastic. I admittedly love a powerful sent, and this one delivers. As others have said, if you leave the bar in your bathroom, the whole room will take on a lasting scent of pine. I've never struggled with dry skin so there wasn't much to improve on here, but I do feel very clean and smooth after using it. 

I did not notice a black film forming on the shower like others have said. Typical soaps that aren't plain white always left a little something, and this went down the drain just like those did.

The bar only last 9 washes for me, but it's important to note that it was my first time ever using it, so for many of these showers I continued to lather up out of pleasure, not necessity. I'm sure once the novelty of the soap wears off, I'll be using it more economically, and I would assume 2 weeks + is very achievable. 

Gold Moss is up next. Thank you for this product. It's invigorating my day every time I use it. I am a natural skeptic, and generally speaking, I tend to poo-poo people who gravitate towards all-natural/organic/vegan products (though using products that don't come from Palm Oil is very, very important to me). I'm not a fan of ""pseudo-sciences"" for lack of a better term. I often feel that if something was truly bad for you, in this age, the information would be out there. But in this case I don't feel my typical thinking applies. It just seems logical to me. Why not use a product that harnesses glycerin instead of replacing it with chemicals? Why not use a product that smells better? Why not use a product that feels better?

The easing of chest acne may be a coincidence. It's come and gone before. I'll know more about that in a month or so because I won't be using anything else (though the signs as of now are promising). The rest I already know. This is the best soap I've ever used.",5,2016-11-17 04:00:00 UTC,70702082,https://drsquatch.com/,Pine Tar,"Rugged, woodsy, and strong, just like a Squatch man should be.",,"Michael, N.",mikewalsh56@gmail.com,US,"Hi Michael! 

Thank you so much for the thoughtful and detailed review. As far as the acne goes, it&#x27;s great to hear that our soap may have helped clear this up a bit. I know that many of our customers have experienced this with Pine Tar. As far as completely fixing acne, in my opinion it is unlikely that any &quot;external&quot; product is going to do that. Yes it may minimize the symptoms mostly or even completely, but the root of acne in adults lies within us and it will likely take dietary or lifestyle modifications to completely cure.",1,2016-11-21 19:34:27 UTC,,

33528932,anonymous,rovsuhtR01AOZ8Vl90zCBkGot9h5DML2IsoJ9tn3,true,A very unique fragrance I think most men will enjoy.,"I'm giving this cologne 5 stars, though I think 4.5 would be more appropriate. Let me start by saying, like Dr. Squatch's soaps, you are in for a very unique experience with Hemlock Trail. As clearly stated, there is only 1 oz of cologne for $42 dollars. That translates to a whopping $143 dollars if you were to average it out to your standard 3.4oz bottle of cologne. That is very, very pricey, gentlemen. I support paying for quality, but it'd be great if we can get that price point down by about 25%. Hopefully that's in the cards as Dr. Squatch continues to grow.

Having said all this, the design of the bottle is FANTASTIC. Aesthetically, it just looks awesome on your shelf. Rugged and old school, and inspires confidence after applying it (which is 1/2 the battle with any cologne!). Additionally, I won't pretend to know the actual engineering here, but there is a some sort of stopper mechanism, so when you are adding a drop to your fingers, you'd have to actually continue dabbing over and over in order to use an excessive amount. With other colognes a couple spritzes can be quite a lot, and then other bottles don't have any kind've stopper on top. But this cologne inspires you to use in moderation, and that will certainly extend the life of the bottle.

Now to the scent... it is wonderful. When taking a whiff directly from the bottle, for me, it came off a little too much like they just extracted pine straight from a Christmas tree and dumped it into the bottle. I started to wonder if this was the right product for me. But fear not! When applying moderate dabs to your pulse points and beard, it really does take on a different, more subtle (yet certainly pronounced and unique) scent that absolutely delivers. The strong Christmasy scent in the bottle somehow begins to embody the earthy and all-natural musk I think most people will be looking for with this product. To be fair, I think part of my initial... skepticism... is that the scent is so interesting and unlike anything you can get in a department store that I almost didn't quite know how to react.

Bottom line... my girlfriend who rarely is a fan of my choices in this department loved the scent. The best way I can describe it, as mentioned earlier, is subtle but pronounced. It has an impact without taking over the room. It also comes off differently at different times for me. I'll smell my pulse point and it'll smell woodsy, and then 10 minutes later if I do it again, and that citrus will make an appearance. That's really cool.

Pros: Unique, enjoyable scent in a wonderful bottle design.
Cons: Pricey, and a bit of an acquired taste for those used to more typical colognes. But that taste will certainly be acquired.

Bottom line: I absolutely recommend it. There is room for improvement with the price, and maybe (emphasis on maybe) there's something that can be done to appease people who don't want to deviate too far from typical scents... but I wouldn't go there. I love it as is!

Thank you so much taking the time to write this amazingly detailed review. I personally wear this all the time and I agree with your comments on the subtlety of the scent. 
 
When you have a blend like this, you typically smell the &quot;top note&quot; out of the bottle which is the citrus and pine, while the other middle and base notes (patchouli and sage) open up more over time and after being applied. 
 
As for the cost, we do appreciate your thoughts here as well and will definitely take it into consideration.

I will be trying it out with a wet bar before I commit to using this on a trip. First, it's a good size. Bar fits fine in the bag. Not too big, not too small. Side seams look sturdy. Next, the drawstrings are a concern. They are essentially very thin twine. I have visions of those breaking in short order, particularly if I or someone else tries to tighten/over-tighten the bag opening. Shouldn't be difficult to replace if they do break, but why not settle for something more durable to begin with, ideally with some sort of slider to keep the strings taut. Thirdly, I have concerns about the absorption qualities. I would feel better if they had doubled up on the material, but right now, it's essentially one layer of canvas, with a loose weave (while you can't see through it, light passes through it with zero problem). Got a bar damp and put it in the bag. Several minutes later, while the bag itself does not appear to be wet, you can feel a very slight dampness through the material.

I'm happy to say the kit is every bit as good as their other stuff, but it comes with a disclaimer.

If you have long hair, do not use conditioner everyday as advertised. Doing so will cause your oils to latch onto your hair like glue, and instead of your hair looking and feeling healthy, it'll look dull, and feel very greasy. You only want to condition the same day you wash, which brings me to another point. Washing your hair every 3-4 days is ideal as you will have to use a bit more than what they recommend in order to give your hair a good clean. This stuff does the job well but working it into a lather is a little more effort than with other shampoos. I recently got a shampoo pump with mine, and I use 1 squeeze of the pump for my top, sides, and back of my scalp, so 4 in total that I use to work into a nice lather. It cleans very well, and doesn't leave your hair damaged or brittle, allowing the oils to come in and give it a fantastic feel and look. 

Aside from that, my only other complaint is the scents, I can not wait to have the shampoo in cool citrus as well, or something that compliments their pine tar soap. 

Those are really my only critiques with this stuff, it's basically everything I wanted, and I will continue to keep using Dr Squatch so long as I possibly can, as far as I'm concerned nothing comes close.",4,2017-01-03 04:00:00 UTC,503651566,https://drsquatch.com/,Hair Care Kit,Buy our shampoo & conditioner together and save 15%,,Ethan,emanson102@yahoo.com,US,,,,,

For years, I have used all types of men's body wash. Most all of the top brands you'd find in most stores, I have them a shot. With the body washes marketed towards men with scents like ""Desire"" ""Manly Man"" ""RattleBear"" ""Glacier"" ""Nighthawk"" ""Dragon Tamer"" you name it, I probably gave it a shot. I read how Dr. Squatch used natural ingredients, and handmade soap, and I have to admit, it caused me to think about what was in all these wild and crazy body washes I'd grown accustomed to. A lot of these body washes had ridiculously strong scents, which I wasn't a fan of. It felt like I was doused in cologne as I showered.

Then, Dr. Squatch arrived. I'll admit, I was a bit weary of bar soaps. I had been scarred into thinking that all bar soaps left my skin feeling like there was residue that left my skin feeling very dry. I gave the ole Sqautch a try, and here it what I loved about it. First, was the lather. This soap really lathered well whether it be scrubbed in my bare skin, or used with a washcloth. The scent was just right, it wasn't too strong, nor to weak. It was the perfect amount for me. The soap washes off easily, and after drying off, I never got the feeling of a residue on my hand. I really like this soap, it just fits my personality and preferences.

Gold Moss is an absolute incredible scent. I really don't know how to describe it. It's a perfect masculine scent that appeals to the men, and the ladies dig it. It's got earthy undertones, with a hint of spice. It smells warm, sophisticated, and what a mature lad should smell like.

36821437,anonymous,rovsuhtR01AOZ8Vl90zCBkGot9h5DML2IsoJ9tn3,true,"Sit Down Son, About to Make you a Man","Pine Tar is absolutely the best scent. I have tried the entire line and I keep coming back to Pine Tar! So, why the title? Well, that is for anyone who would give this lower than a 3 star.

Complaint 1) Dont like the pine smell? I do enjoy intellectually stimulating conversations involving differing opinions. The pine tar soap has a very successful aroma therapeutic effect. Something along the lines of tearing a pine tree out of the ground with your bare hands and rubbing that conifer all over your body. 

Complaint 2) Doesn't last long? This is most likely not the fault of the product. You most likely are putting your bar into the line of fire of your faucet. Water + Soap = Conversion to Suds = Soap Dissolving. OR perhaps you are placing it onto a flat/solid surface with no ventilation to allow the soap to dry which leaves your poor soap to soak in a puddle of water. I refer to the equation again. OR you are holding the soap in your hand and lathering your body directly for the entirety of your shower. Equation still applies. I recommend using a lathering apparatus such as a loofah. Don't worry, the soap more than makes up for the unmanly loofah, besides your soap will last a month and being practical and wise is manly. Do keep the equation in mind. It will help you be wise with your investment.

Complaint 3) Do not like the black scum? Well, the bar is black, it produces black scum. All soap produces a viscous matter you refer to as soap scum. So this is not unique to the pine tar soap; only the black color. This should not be held against the product. It should be met with understanding and acceptance. 

Thank you, Dr Squatch, for a fantastic bar soap.",5,2017-03-01 04:00:00 UTC,70702082,https://drsquatch.com/,Pine Tar,"Rugged, woodsy, and strong, just like a Squatch man should be.",,Brock,fantanimator@yahoo.com,US,"Hi Brock!

Dries out hair even with conditioner!,"This shampoo has a lot of what it feels like acidic components (I want to say its heavy on the citrus ingredients) that cause my hair to get a slight burning feeling and also strip everything off the hair itself. It dries it out really bad and it also makes it just not feel right. I used this for around a month before I made my review and I have to say Yes....it will clean your hair but it will strip off any oils you have. Now if you have oily hair or you just finished that grimy job at work I think this will work out ok. But if your in a cold, dry area like WA state then its a recipe for disaster. I only used it 1-2x a week as well. I always used the conditioner right after to get it to feel better but even as a combo it feels very ""rubbery"". Hard to explain but its like you cleaned the plastic tupperware bin from your sink with a strong soap and get that squeaky clean feel to it when you run your hands across it. Very rubbery and tough. Overall this shampoo is VERY strong and I would say maybe cut it to 1 time every 2 weeks. It does what it states but it also isn't very soothing or pleasing to use. I wish the shampoo cleaned my hair without being so rough or so drying to the point it makes my hair brittle. If this was a bit less harsh then I would enjoy it more. Save your money and buy the bar soap. Rub bar soap in on your head, rinse, and then add conditioner with it.

It moisturizes it very well to the point that even when I'm done drying off with a towel, my hair still feels very slick and slightly wet. Doesn't have a greasy feel or anything it just feels like really nice hair. I also noticed my hair color change just a bit. I have black hair and when I started using this (been using it for 1 month), my hair changed to a really dark brown. I also didnt get that much of any tingling sensation like others say in their reviews. I do get a slight cooling feel to it which is nice. 

 The consistency is also really good. I put it in a dispenser so whenever I need it, its easy for me to portion control it. A little goes a long way! It feels like its not real thick when it gets in your hair but don't let that fool you. Its a very milky consistency comparable to hand lotion so when using this in a pump setup, you shouldn't experience any clogging. Overall great product that with the size bottle these guys sell, you can rest assured this bottle will go a LONG way. Don't let the price deter you from purchasing it. I have used this every day (2x a day) for a month and I probably have gone through a bit over 1/4 of a bottle. One tip....dont buy the shampoo! Just use your hand soap and this product. Shampoo isn't the best (really dries your hair out) but using this with the bar soap is a perfect combo!

The Dr. Squatch shampoo smells amazing and lathers well, hair feels clean and I feel more confident about not rubbing gnarly chemicals on my head every day. The conditioner also smells great, and after leaving it in for a couple minutes as directed, hair feels smooth and soft. After a few weeks of use, I definitely felt like my hair had a little more life and resilience compared to feeling beaten down and scorched by the old stuff.

I bought a second hair care kit within a couple weeks because I liked it so much and figured I should just get more to have on hand when I run out.

The Nautical Sage started out a little too strong on the ""sage side"" - but, seeing as the sent has all but disappeared after 1 weeks use - it is no longer a problem. Like most of the complaints below - you are lucky to get the physical bar to last a full month. To give potential users some perspective: 1.) I do shower daily - sometimes twice a day depending on my workout schedule, 2.) I am not super ""Squatchy"" hairy - but do sport a healthy coverage throughout/overall - so I am sure that uses more soap. As to complaints about the bar falling apart - both of mine have not. I did make sure to purchase the Squatch soap holder and that seems to help. Lastly - I have taken the remnants of my first bar of soap and put it and some water into my ""TSA approved shampoo container"" and created a usable liquid soap for use on my business trips (hint, hint, Dr. Squatch - when are you coming out with some liquid soaps???). Bottom line - yes, I would buy again. Love the natural approach and the initial scent. I look forward to trying the other scents.

First thing I noticed was when I ripped open the padded envelope it comes in, that beautiful Nautical Sage scent hit me in the old olfactory nerves and scent me to heaven. I couldn't wait to try it out. It cam in a nice little box with ingredients listed on it and a little blurb about the story of Dr. Squatch. Well lets get to the important stuff. Now I'm a guy who likes his soap to lather and I also like the scent of the soap to last at least half the day if not longer. Well this soap delivers in the lather department for sure and the scent permeates through the whole bathroom while you're using it. Sadly that wonderful Nautical Sage scent goes straight down the drain as soon as you rinse the soap off. I was so disappointed in this soap as far as how long the scent lasts. When you have so many different scents to offer in your products and that scent only lasts while you're in the shower, I'd say you're doing your customers a disservice because that bar of soap costs upwards of $7 to $10 and that aint cheap for a bar of soap. Yeah it's natural and all but the scent is 90% of the sale. Bottom line, if I'm going to pay an arm and a leg for a bar of soap, I want that arm and leg to smell like that bar of soap for most of the day. Pun intended. I'm sorry to say that when I'm done with my wonderful bar of Dr. Squatch Nautical Sage soap, I'll be moving on and this time I wont be so foolish as to fall for some newfangled natural great smelling soap. Thank you Dr. Squatch for a great time in the shower, even though it didn't last, I still wish you good luck and may you be prosperous in the years to come.",3,2017-06-06 04:00:00 UTC,112874164,https://drsquatch.com/,Nautical Sage,"A refreshing mix of cypress, lavender, and sage.",,D.

The next day, as I was preparing to shower, I reached for the Travel Bag and it was already fairly soaked. I open and pulled the soap out and it had become fairly soft, almost to the point of decomposing. A portion of the soap was still inside the bag, unavailable for me to use in the shower. I found this to be unacceptable. I went to my CVS Pharmacy and purchased a plastic soap container for under a dollar and that appeared to have solved the problem.

That, right off the bat has me thinking this has GOT to be special to be worth the additional expense. Like most informed consumers, I read the reviews prior to purchasing. They sounded so good I seldom found a negative. ""Hm. Only employees writing reviews?"", I wondered. Looking for a woodsy, pine scent that lasts with a natural bar, I gave this a shot. 

Much ado about not much, to be honest. Everybody is different. But based on the comments, I was expecting to be knocked out with the strength of the smell of pine and all things forest. Not so. Because of the reviews and comments, this was weak. 

Not a fan of exfoliating. But that was my choice. But I was looking for a natural bar soap with a lasting aroma. I was hoping to have found the Holy Grail of my quest, but ultimately realize that its not so. 

I would not order this again because exfoliating annoys me and this just didn't deliver as advertised. The scent faded as soon as it washed off.

I say that in a good way. It's like having a belt sander in your shower. Any dead skin cells and dirt deposits don't stand a chance against this scrub. Some people may not like that. I love it.

The let down, for me, is in the fragrance, or lack there of. It smells very, very good if you sniff the bar, but the smell does not translate to the skin at all. After drying off, it's almost gone. By the time I get to work (30 minutes later) my skin smells like nothing. No good woodsy ""Dr. Squatch"" type of...anything. 

As a skin exfoliation bar, I absolutely LOVE IT!!! My problem areas (exfoliation-wise) are never a problem when I use this. I will say however that, when I use it, my butthole seems more itchy soon after then when I use some regular-ass soap from the store like ""Coast"" or ""Dial"" or even ""Lever 2000"".

The soaps didn’t smell like they were too strong, and that put me off. After using them in the shower though, that’s when it all started. I felt my face twitch, and contort. I stumbled out of the shower to view myself in the mirror, and I had a full Viking beard! I was amazed! I had shaved the night before, so there’s no way this should be possible? I then felt a sudden surge of power, and I jumped though my roof and flew to the nearest forest like super man. When I found myself in the forest, I then realized that I had spontaneously devolved an 8 pack, and a thick coat of manly, good smelling body hair. All the animals in the forest came to hang out, I cracked open a beer with Bigfoot, and then I came home to write this review.

So good, I had to write a review on it!! First, thing that hits you is the scent - masculine, not overpowering, smooooooth. And, though the description of it says the scent is mild - it's a strong (again not overpowering) scent -that lasts! I've gotten so many compliments on it from my friends and from the guys at the gym after I shower (weird, but cool) - it's my must-go-to soap on my nights out. After using it, you feel like you have this micro layer of of nourishing oil..then, you rinse and the big surprise comes - you SQUEAK!! Literally, my skin felt squeaky clean. So, I figured being squeaky clean equals all the Deep Sea Goat's Milk washed off. Not so! My skin stayed nourished that my normal routine of slathering on lotion after the shower has decreased. I mean, I still do it but, without the slathering. Now, for the surprise that I didn't expect. EVERY SINGLE product, including unscented products, my cats shy away from. Yes, I'm a manly man with cats, leave it alone. This product is soooo natural that my cats did NOT shy away or turn their face when they came up to me to pet them, RIGHT after I got finished using the soap. Aaaaamazing. I'm about to post on the Dr. Squatch conditioner. THAT's another amazing product. Thanks Dr. Squatch!!! Ordering some more, buddy.

 Overall, I was not very impressed with the soaps I've sampled so far, for the following reasons:
 1) The soapholder, after being in contact with the used bar of soap, created an unbreakable bond. Despite my efforts to separate them, I ended up chucking both in the trash.
 2) I was expecting a strong odor, both from the soap and after using it on my skin, but the smell was anything but bold. My sense of smell is just fine, thank you.

The good news is your soap agrees with my sensitive skin.

58394656,anonymous,rovsuhtR01AOZ8Vl90zCBkGot9h5DML2IsoJ9tn3,false,I want to love this,"Let me start by saying I am on soapscription and all I use to wash my body is Dr. Squatch. I love love love their soap. I also love wet shaving, have been doing it for years and have tried many different soaps from various companies.
I unfortunately do not love this soap. The ingredient list including bentonite clay, the scent, and the slickness are all great, but the soap just does not lather properly. I'm surprised to see other reviews saying it does and I have to assume that the recent recipe or batch that I've received two tins from are somehow different.
After writing Dr. Squatch detailing my issues with my first purchase, their awesome customer service provided me with a second tin to try, but it also had the same: an extremely foamy and airy lather that dissolved & dissipated on the face quickly. I've shaved 6 times with the soap now and have let the soap bloom and tried working the lather for several minutes. I tried face lathering, hand lathering, scuttle lathering and even applying the puck directly to my face. The last method works to apply a thick paste to my face which seems like it's working, but with the slightest introduction of water there comes that airy foam that dissolves before you finish a pass.
I've tried very hard to get this soap to work for me but just have to give up at this point. I hope the doctor fixes the recipe.",2,2018-05-01 04:00:00 UTC,83120728,https://drsquatch.com/,Shave Bar,Raise the Bar on Shaving,http://s3.amazonaws.com/yotpo-images-production/Product/16646076/12250703/thumb.png,Jeremy,jeremytrem@gmail.com,US,,,,,

Thanks for reaching out to us! That&#x27;s a great question! The main reason our hair-care products are packaged in differently sized bottles is that our shampoo is designed to only be used 2-3 times per week, while our conditioner is designed to be used daily! 

Our shampoo is also a concentrated formula (and functions as a clarifying shampoo), and the size difference between these bottles is to further encourage this type of washing regiment (rather than using shampoo every day)!

Currently, if you use our shampoo at a rate of 1 tsp of per shower, and shower two-three times per week, it can last between 3-4 months. However, if you use 1 tbsp per shower and shower two-three times per week, it can last for over a month. Our conditioner should last for the same amount of time (assuming you shower 5 times per week, and use conditioner daily, but only use shampoo 2-3 times per week). So while they come in differently sized bottles, if used as intended, they should run-out at approximately the same time! Feel free to let us know if you have any other questions regarding our products! Have a squatch-tastic day! Thank you!",1,2018-05-23 18:32:43 UTC,,

Boy was I glad I did! First of all I had always washed my hair everyday with just normal 2 in 1 shampoo and my hair has always been thin and delicate. But now after a few months of using these products and washing my hair only 2-3 times per week but using the conditioner everyday my hair has transformed! It is now way thicker and stronger and it seems to even grow much faster now. Also the shampoo smells freaking amazing as well as the conditioner. I love the tingly feeling the conditioner gives after letting it sit for a min or two. Anyways i highly suggest you try this and pair it with the bar soaps(pine tar is my favorite).

60048337,anonymous,rovsuhtR01AOZ8Vl90zCBkGot9h5DML2IsoJ9tn3,true,Great Soap,"So I’ve used many different brands of pine tar soap. I use it for tattoo healing, for my face, for my scalp and beard, and usually once a week in my whole body. I tried Dr. Squatch pine tar when the normal brand I buy was out of stock and hadn’t been refilled in stock for a while (this happens at times with hand made soaps). I read some reviews and purchased Dr. Squatch and I’ve got to say this is some of the best soap I’ve ever used. The scent is awesome and the sand grit is great for exfoliating and leaves you feeling clean and your skin tingly. People have talked about the soap not lasting, a helpful hint is to cut the bar down into smaller sections and use up a section at a time. This helps the soap to last longer and the bars are more manageable. Either way, the soap lasts just as long as other brands I’ve used. But for the soap...I’m a believer and Dr. Squatch is my brand! I’m going to stick with them and try out some of the other scents. Just an FYI...my teenage daughters use the pine tar soap on their faces and the results are better than the harsh chemical facial washes you can buy. They wash with the pine tar soap and then use Thayers Witch Hazel with Lavender. They’ve had great success and enjoy the scent as much as I do. You CANNOT go wrong with this soap. If you don’t like it you’re honestly just nit picking and probably don’t like anything 100%. I’m going to buy this as gifts for other family members wanting a natural hand made bar. Can’t say enough good about it.

At times a lot of those soaps would dry my skin out or because of the additives would make my skin break out, even give me rashes in places they don’t need to be. Then randomly I saw your add and thought why not, maybe this soap will live up to the promise of saving my sack, so I placed my order, all while laughing at the Dr. Squatch commercial I just saw. Waited a few days and then boom order came in. Never had I been so excited to see this soap, or any soap for that matter. After using it for over a week now I have to say this soap truly is everything it says it is. There’s no strong soap smell but yet a pleasant aroma that sticks around with you, not overbearing, just present enough to keep you fresh throughout the day.

Not only is it great for your skin and all natural, but the scents are both wonderful AND manly, not an easy to achieve combo (I especially like golden moss and pine tar). If any man needs a good soap, I would highly recommend Dr. Squatch, just as I’ve already recommended it to all of my friends. Thank you and keep up the good work! (P.S. please release an all natural deodorant soon!)",5,2018-06-18 04:00:00 UTC,270516023,https://drsquatch.com/,Soapscription - 3 Bars per Quarter,3 Bars Delivered Quarterly,,Trever M.,trevermoll@gmail.com,US,,,,,

It smelled like I had just rolled around in oranges that had spent a week in my cedar closet. I had been plagued with itchy dry skin for years. In three showers, that was gone. The soap lasted for 2.5 weeks lathering liberally on a washcloth with the water off and using the soap saver. The brief duration of the soap is actually nice, because I found I was starting to get nose-blind to the scent around the 2 week mark. 

I will definitely be starting a Soapscription with this bar at the top of my list.

My only two complaints: 
1. The travel bag is out of stock. I'd love to take Dr. Squatch with me on my upcoming vacations. Putting it in a plastic baggy will keep unnecessary moisture on the soap, thus drastically shortening its life.
2. I don't get to try out the Sudsfaction Guarantee, because this is, in fact, the best soap I have ever used.",5,2018-06-18 04:00:00 UTC,70701577,https://drsquatch.com/,Cedar Citrus,A refreshing and energizing blend of rustic cedar and zesty orange oils.,http://s3.amazonaws.com/yotpo-images-production/Product/16645935/12250636/thumb.png,Aaron M.

I bought the big, cheap 2-in-1 dandruff shampoo and conditioner from a local warehouse (let the reader understand). As a man who wears a black shirt with a white collar everyday, it was always embarrassing how many white flakes were on my shoulders. After a week of using these products (shampooing on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays; conditioning everyday), the dryness and itchiness have both almost subsided. My shoulders also reflect this change. My scalp and hair have begun to adjust to the new regiment. My wife also appreciates how soft this makes my beard feel.
What's more, this stuff smells amazing and feels even better on the scalp.

It snapped in half after 3 uses and then crumbled when I tried to fuse them together. It was bad and I just threw it away. The scent was nice, but I was afraid to use the other 5 bars of soap I purchased, but the Pine Tar was very interesting. At first I was not ready for the sandpaper like feel at first and on my face after shaving it was not fun. So the first day, I was questioning the logic of such a bar. I never exfoliated before I guess, so this was something I was not prepared for. The second day, the rough exterior of the bar lessened a tad or I just got used to it, and I discovered that I rather enjoyed the feel of it. The more I used it, the more I enjoyed the texture and scent. The only issue I had was that it melted in the final stage, but it is way better than breaking into tiny little pieces.

For the first 14.5 years in service, I used the shave gel and razors with a billion blades on it and dealt with razor burn, pimples and constant ingrown hairs along my neck and under the kin from the chin strap. It also cost a ton of money. I decided to switch to just a safety razor and shave soap from Van Der Hagen. Pimples stopped skin felt better with no razor burn, but got lots of cuts learning a new shave method. When I saw your guys commercial on face creep, I laughed at it and was like awesome telling the truth about today's soap. But then I thought, what these dudes are on to something because I always have dry skin and still get the ingrown hairs. So I dived in and got a bar of your Cedar Citrus and shave soap. Gents after only showering for a week and shaving with your soap, my skin feels great and my face is smooth and clear. I wake up and can't wait to shave before going to physical fitness and then can't wait to get in the shower to smell the soap. So refreshing. Yes itdoes sound like I am in love with your soap. I may be. Any hoot. Keep up the great work. You have a customer for life.

I tried the pine tar first because I think I liked that one the best. I read a previous review where a guys soap cracked and fell apart, and he was told to put it somewhere in the shower where it could get water on it and not dry out. Thats what I did with mine (I put it in the shower spot assigned to my stuff due to my wife and her two daughters over abundance of shower supplies). Having said that, I think all the females in the house taking showers are too much for the soap to handle, because it is now 1/4 of the size it was, and today is only Thursday. I don’t know if all the girls showering is too much water for it to handle or not, but I put it Behind the shower curtain this morning, so hopefully it’ll do better with not so much water on it. If it weren’t for that, I would give it a 5 star rating because I love it!! But I can’t be sure it’s entirely the girls’ fault. If getting it away from the women’s overspray fixes the problem, I will come back and update my review to 5 stars, and let all the Squatches out there know to keep it away from a household of women’s shower spray.

83227047,anonymous,rovsuhtR01AOZ8Vl90zCBkGot9h5DML2IsoJ9tn3,false,I Wanted More...,"I have a few good things to say and a few bad things to say, but I won't demand a refund because I'm a good sport and I tried something and it wasn't exactly what I wanted. Big deal.

First the bad:

Maybe this is just soap itself with my skin, or maybe I need something lotion based because my skin always feels rather dry or tacky when I used the soap. I've used not only the bar, but a lather builder and a loofah to exfoliate to no avail with this bar of soap (I did not attempt any other bar while using this one.) Secondly, the scent is not an all day thing, actually it's not even a morning thing, if you were expecting that from the ""ultramasculine"" yet funny commercial you'll likely be disappointed. Also, the pine tar oil is so present that it will literally drip down your shower wall when it's wet.


The good news:

The soap smells absolutely fantastic. It's an incredibly delightful experience while in use, builds lather instantly and lasts with a lather builder for an entire shower with minimal application (something not always common in organic soaps as they tend to fall apart, so I'll say that's just a sign this is a good quality product.) 

Summary:

I've not written off Dr Squatch yet, I'll continue to use it till it's gone, and maybe I'll try a different bar, but if I could get a suggestion for a bar leaving my skin feeling less dried out or Squatch comes out with a moisturizer then I'm game for more because I really did like the the scent, quality of the bar, and the overall (more) organic structure of it as a product.",3,2019-03-11 04:00:00 UTC,70702082,https://drsquatch.com/,Pine Tar,"Rugged, woodsy, and strong, just like a Squatch man should be.",,Rob N.,rnolan86@gmail.com,US,,,,,

The smell filled the whole bathroom, my kids were wondering what was going on in there, I had to open the window and put the soaps in baggies, it still took several hours for the smell to dissipate! I still wanted to give the soap a try, if the soap was nice then maybe I could justify trying a different scent. But the soap is way to harsh to be used on skin! It left my skin feeling tight, dry, and itchy, I had to moisturize after showering which I never have to do with my current soap. We use very natural soaps but wanted to move away from plastic, so bar soap would accomplish this nicely, but this bar soap is unusable (well I'm thinking tough jobs like scrubbing out the trash can or maybe the duck's pool, as long as I have gloves on to protect my skin from the soap, this soap could be very useful in those types of applications).
