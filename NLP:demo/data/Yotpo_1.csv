True,gorgeous soaps!!!,Cool Fresh Aloe,"I bought the soaps for a Christmas gift.  They are for my son-in-law.  We won't know how he likes them until after Christmas.  I must say, they all smell great.  I'll be very surprised if he does not like them.",5,2012-12-01 04:00:00+00:00,109191428
True,Soap Saver - Works Great!,Soap Saver,"This works great to eliminate the gooey, slimy, slippery bar of soap that you get when you place your soap in a normal soap dish or just put the soap on a shelf.  

I use Sasquatch soap every day for shower, shaving, and shampoo.  With the Sasquatch Soap Saver, I have a completely dry bar of soap every morning, and have been able to get MORE than a month out of every bar.  

The cedar smells good, looks good, cleans up easily, and the grooves allow air to completely circulate around the bar so it dries out rapidly instead of dissolving.

You need this if you are using bar soap.",5,2012-12-04 04:00:00+00:00,113623428
True,Husband with Sensitive Skin,Gift Box,"My husband has sensitive skin and we have been searching for years for an affordable natural soap that does not cause any reactions to his skin.  Sasquatch Soap Company has done it!  SO far so good.  I purchased the soap gift box providing a variety of soaps for my husband to choose from.  He LOVES the Gold Moss Scrub.  I was surprised it left his skin feeling clean to the touch but not dry like other soaps and he smells fantastic!  He cannot wait to try the other soaps available in the set.  I love the soap! 
Sasquatch Soap Co., thank you for providing such a variety of high quality soaps for sensitive skinned people like my husband.  We will be back!

True,No Name,Soap Saver,"though the wooden holder is smaller than expected and considerably smaller than the soap bars, it does the job of draining and holding.   Too soon to know how it will ""hold up""",4,2013-02-07 04:00:00+00:00,113623428
True,Especially sudsy and creamy if,Eucalyptus Greek Yogurt,"Especially sudsy and creamy if your water is soft/conditioned.   Less lather in harder water though cleaning is fine.   However, expect bar's life to be shortened in harder water.   Scent is pleasant and not overpowering.  I will buy again.    It helps that my water at home is conditioned though I've used this soap ""on the road"" less effectively and enjoyably.",5,2013-02-19 04:00:00+00:00,109191328

True,Quite possibly my favorite Sasquatch scent,Gold Moss Scrub,"I love the scent of this soap, but I feel like it's not quite strong enough. That's just my personal opinion, though.

True,Great Soap albeit scratchy,Pine Tar,"I really enjoy the scent of the Pine Tar soap. It stays around for a long time and has an awesome, masculine smell that both my girlfriend and I enjoy. The scent sticks longest in hairier areas, so my beard ends up having an awesome aroma all day. The only reasons I cannot give it 5 stars is that the soap doesn't quite foam up enough for me compared to the other soap I've gotten from Sasquatch (Cool Water). Also, the particles in the soap can be a bit scratchy, although that came and went depending on what stage of use I was at. 

Even with those slight issues, the scent is above and beyond for me. It has beat out Cool Water, so it's on to Gold Moss Scrub and Bay Rum to see what gets top spot.",4,2013-03-20 04:00:00+00:00,109191256

False,Wow,Gift Box,"I stumbled upon Sasquatch Soap Co., when my husband requested that I find and buy him some ""man soap"". Seeing the gift idea, I went ahead and ordered it-we were both blown away when it arrived. The cigar box was completely sturdy, and the soap selection was awesome. He loves it, and has requested that once he uses this soap that I order him some more. Its strong enough that it lasts all day, but not over powering in any way. And, as a perk, we live in Utah's high mountains at 7000 feet elevation, where the air is extremely dry...he has not needed lotion to hydrate his skin since he began using the soap.",5,2013-03-26 04:00:00+00:00,110663055

True,Great Gift,Gift Box,"My boyfriend loved this. He has been using Sasquatch soap for awhile but I wanted to get him more but a little more special. The box was really cool. Two of the soaps he has tried before and two of them he hadn't. I don't think he would have ever tried them if i hadn't bought him the gift box.

True,This program is a DREAM!,SoapScription - Deluxe,"The ironic thing about your name is that finding a good natural bar of soap for men was like searching for bigfoot!  I'm just glad that I've found you guys!  I've been using Sasquatch for several months now, with my only complaint being that I would continue to have to reorder whenever I ran out, and wait for it to ship (I'm a bit of a procrastinator).  I would then be stuck using non-natural products (or going no showers) until my new sasquatch was being delivered.  Soapscriptions that problem away!  I splurged for the Deluxe, and my first shipment of 8 bars came in today and it was like Christmas morning!  I officially threw out my back-up non-natural bars knowing that the next shipment will come before I run out.

True,Squatch Saver ,Soap Saver,I bought the soap saver to save my soap.  It is saving my soap this very instant.  It is smaller than it appears in the pictures.  There is a faint pine smell that reminds me of pine trees.  My beef with the triple S is that the soap sticks to it when it dries. This might stop after a while. I will continue to use the soap saver despite all of this. I really like the soap.  I think it softens my skin and leaves me with the perfect amount of moisture. ,3,2013-10-03 04:00:00+00:00,113623428

True,Handy just pretty over priced,Soap Saver,"Its handy to have, but is basically a routered section of 2x4. For some reason I thought it would be different. Pretty over priced for what it is. I do still love the soaps and packaging, but $6 for a $0.50 piece of pine that got run through a routing table for 20 seconds? Ouch.",3,2013-10-21 04:00:00+00:00,113623428

True,Love this soap!,Gift Box,"The gift box is great. It was shipped promptly and was packaged really well in a bubble wrap envelope inside of a shipping box. The cigar box is a really nice touch. The outside of the box even smells like cigars! But when you open the box, you get the great aromas of the soaps. I got Pine Tar, Gold Moss Scrub, Citrus Cedar, and Eucalyptus Greek Yogurt, all of which smell great! I will definitely be ordering more soap and trying other scents when I run out of these.

True,"Yep, I'm addicted!",Gold Moss Scrub,"Gold Moss Scrub smells great after its first use, meaning its a little strong upon arrival but that is to be expected (its not a complaint). It cleans really well and as an added bonus, it keeps the bathroom smelling a little bit better.

True,Borderline false advertising on soap saver.,Soap Saver,"The soap was great.  The soap saver was a joke.  The picture online makes it look like the soap saver is nearly as big as one of the bars of soap, when in reality it is much smaller.  The picture online shows a three-ridge, square soap saver when the actual soap saver is just a narrow, two-ridge piece of wood.  Also, the picture online shows that the bottom of the soap saver is flat, when in reality it has ridges on both sides.  This makes it difficult for me to place it on the wire mesh shower caddy I had planned on using it on as the ridges go through the wire.  

I will continue to buy soap from you guys because I really like the gold moss soap, but you should either get soap savers that resemble the online pictures or stop selling them because I cannot imagine anyone has a postive reaction when they receive the JV version of the soap saver you are currently shipping out.  ",3,2013-12-04 04:00:00+00:00,113623428
True,Its Great,Soap Saver,I have started to use the soap savers and they really help make the soap last even longer as well as keep it from sliding from the side of the shower. So glad I bought them!,5,2013-12-05 04:00:00+00:00,113623428

True,Very happy!,Gift Box,"I love the gift box!  The cigar box adds a unique touch.  It was packaged neatly with all the soaps inside.  Everything arrived in tact and within the stated delivery time.  The only reason for the four stars instead of five is that I requested a soap that I did not get.  I wanted Gold Moss Scrub and instead I got Cool Fresh Aloe.  Was a little disappointed in that.  But overall, very satisfied!",4,2013-12-11 04:00:00+00:00,110663055
True,Little Box of awesome,Gift Box,"I got the cigar box because I wasn't sure where to start with trying the soaps.

True,"Great for skin, but do not apply directly to balls",Pine Tar,"This stuff is awesome. I can actually feel the oatmeal ripping the skin off of my body, and it makes me feel like a man. A man that exfoliates. With this in mind, don't try scrubbing your balls with it directly unless you're one of those weird dudes that likes the feeling of sandpaper on his thrill drill. It's probably the strongest smelling soap I've ever used, but that's a good thing - I don't wear cologne usually, so this pretty much has me covered. 9/10, would scrub again. But not my balls.",4,2013-12-13 04:00:00+00:00,109191256

True,Does its job,Soap Saver,"My boyfriend has become obsessed with Sasquatch's Pine Tar soap but we found he was going through it very fast. I purchased the soap saver to try and extend the life of his soap and he has noticed his Pine Tar bars are lasting a bit longer, maybe an extra week or so.

I now I add the bar to every Bespoke Post box AND have ordered extra on the Sasquatch site. I love the way it makes him smell, and so does he. He's a pretty active, outdoorsy type of guy so this scent is perfect for him, yet still smells clean and fresh. I've also noticed a difference from the oatmeal exfoliates in the bar. His skin is smoother and softer, while still smelling like a man. He refuses to use any other soap now! LOVE this stuff!",5,2013-12-26 04:00:00+00:00,109191256

To me, the smell was a bit to sweet and not very manly. I expected a more woodsy, Christmas tree smell, but to me it just smelled like spearmint chewing gum. Not really my cup of tea. 

If you like the woodsy, earthy scent and prefer a more manly aroma, I recommend jumping strait to the Pine Tar soap. That is one of my favorite soaps I have ever used. Highly recommend!",4,2014-01-10 04:00:00+00:00,109191130

But I've tried 3 different bars so far, and they don't seem to last very long. I get about 7-10 days use out of them before they crumble apart. I just can't justify spending ~$6 (+shipping) a bar for a week/week and a half's worth of use.",3,2014-01-31 04:00:00+00:00,152703295

True,Not wowed by this soap.,Spearmint Basil Scrub,"For the Christmas season, I bought a few bars of soap from Sasquatch Soap Co.  Spearmint Basil Scrub is the first soap I'm trying.  

I have hard water so I'm used to the dryness and 'clean feeling'.

I thought I'd give the soap a generous try before commenting.  It does have some moisturizers.  It leaves a very light scent if any at all.  It's not a long lasting scent.  ""Scrub"" is not a characteristic I would have included in the product description.

IMHO this soap is not for me.  I was not wowed by this soap",1,2014-02-05 04:00:00+00:00,109191130
True,I like this soap A LOT,Cedar Citrus,"I just started using this soap a week ago.  

I have hard water and I'm used to it.

It has a strong scent and it has serious hang time.  Even my bath towels has this scent now.  It doesn't have a whole lot of moisturizers.  It smells like 65% citrus 35% cedar-ish.  The cedar smell is what lasts long.

I would buy this soap again.",5,2014-02-05 04:00:00+00:00,154635089
True,Disappointed,Gift Box,My husband is a HUGE fan of the soap but I was disappointed in the gift box because I was expecting a more rustic box that matches/resembled the soap's style or picture. Instead it was sent in a velvet covered modern-looking cigar box. No big deal but I was disappointed as was he (it was a gift for his birthday). I would recommend the soap but definitely not the gift box set. He's ordered the soap before and loved it....I was just hoping for something equally appealing when I got him the box gift.,3,2014-02-06 04:00:00+00:00,110663055

True,Pine Tar is simply amazing,Pine Tar,"I originally tried this item as a sample from Birchbox Man.  I enjoyed the soap so much that I ordered the full size along with two other types.  The smell is very rich and strong, but isn't overwhelming after use.  You won't walk around all day smelling like a pine tree.  I'm a big fan of the exfoliants that are in the soap as well.  I like this product a lot and feel like it spices up my normally boring morning ritual.",5,2014-02-07 04:00:00+00:00,109191256
True,Can't get enough!,Pine Tar,"I recently ordered four bars. The Gold Moss, Bay Rum, Pine Tar, and Cedar Citrus.

True,Great soap-wouldn't recommend buying the box gift set,Gift Box,"My husband loves the soap & rightfully so...smells awesome! I was disappointed in the box that came with the gift set. I was led to believe it would either be wooden (like in the picture) or at least rustic looking--like the soap. Instead, it arrived in a black velvet modern-looking cigar box. I was bummed but even more so when I gave it to my husband for valentines day & he said ""oh I love the soap! But dang, I was hoping I'd get the wooden box like in the picture!""

Pine is the ""strongest"" of the bars in my opinion as far as scent and exfoliation is concerned. Could be harsh in the skin if you are not used to a tough bar like this (exfoliation wise not chemical wise). Just a heads up. ",5,2014-03-03 04:00:00+00:00,109191256

Anyway I was introduced to this product line through Bespoke Post. Fell in love with the soap and have been wanting to try others. Love the scent of this soap. Only draw back is the soap is black.

True,Works well but goes fast,Pine Tar,"When I first opened the box I expected to be punched in the face by a pine tree, hoping someone finally got it right, but alas it was the same pine smell I am used to when you buy anything that is scented. Using the soap in the shower; I noticed it lathered well, exfoliated very well, cleaned up my flaky skin, but left a nice black soap scum trail from the soap shelf in the corner despite being out if the shower spray. The soap itself went extremely fast but I assume that is what you get when you don't want something factory made.

True,"Great soap, but not very scrubby",Spearmint Basil Scrub,"I love the quality of this soap. It cleans well, lathers well and smells great. However, as a scrubbing bar it leaves much to be desired. Perhaps I received a bar from a batch where the scrubbing bits were not as evenly mixed, or there was a flaw in production. 
 
Also, while the soap does smell wonderful, the sharp scent of spearmint lasted only as long as the first shower. The basil scent lasted only a day or two longer. Both can still be smelled if one holds the soap to one's nose, but the bar and the lather really only have a vague, though pleasant, floral scent. 
 
Still, this is great soap. I very much like the way it cleans. I only wish it was as sharp smelling as it was when I opened the shipping package.",3,2014-09-01 04:00:00+00:00,109191130

After learning about the chemicals used in commercial products and their health effects, I decided to turn to a more natural solution. Squatch does a great job of listing the ingredients used, all of which I am comfortable with putting on my body, and comes in environmentally safe packaging. Double win! 
 
The consistency of the soap may seem unusual for first timers transitioning from commercial soap. Natural soap tends to break down easier, especially if you leave your bar of soap next to the bath tub or where it is constantly splashed by your shower, so make sure to keep it on your caddie if you plan on keeping it for long.",4,2014-09-12 04:00:00+00:00,109191256

The fact that the dish is made of cedar wood keeps my shower smelling pleasant and refreshing when it steams up. it also keeps the flies out. And the termites. They buzz right off. The two complaints I have about the dish aren't a huge problem to me, but do keep it from being a five star knockout product. Whether it's the soap or the dish, all of my Dr. Squatch brand soaps (Pine Tar, Bay Rum, and Cedar Citrus) have a tendency to stick to the dish. It takes a bit to unstick the soaps, and occasionally I mar the bar. This next issue may be an issue of newness, but the dish tends to secrete a dark oil when it starts absorbing moisture. The oil hasn't stained anything, but it does discolor the soap and get all over the shower. 
 
Definitely a very good product, and one I would recommend to others. It does have those two issues however.",4,2014-11-19 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Not too shabby at all,Eucalyptus Greek Yogurt,"Overall I really enjoyed this soap; the scent, the exfoliating oatmeal, very good stuff. However, the only thing that kept me from giving this bar five stars is the fact that the scent of the soap is SUPER STRONG when it's not in your body and just chilling in its natural bar state. Not a problem for me, but the wife didn't like it. Apparently it throws off the other scented items she puts around the house. Other than that, top notch soap.",4,2014-11-29 04:00:00+00:00,109191328

True,Gold Moss Scrub,Gold Moss Scrub,"This was my first time using anything other than bodywash or mass-produced soap bars. 
 
Wow. 
 
I was pretty excited that the Gold Moss scrub left essentially no film. That was what drove me away from bar soap to begin with. 
 
Also, the smell. While not overpowering, I find myself walking around daily with the faint aroma of what I could only describe as 'the woods'. I no longer smell like a boring white guy...I smell like a man of the wilderness. 
 
The only issue I had with the process was that the soap actually made it into my city 5 days before it was delivered. I assume this is due to the transfer from UPS to USPS. But once I received the soap, there were no complaints to be had.",5,2014-12-10 04:00:00+00:00,109191402

True,Good smelling sandpaper,Pine Tar,I'm guessing these guys changed up the ingredients for this soap because it now has sand in it which isn't listed on the webpage.

True,Great Gift or a Treat for Yourself,Gold Moss Scrub,"I bought a few of these soaps as a gift for someone that always jokes about Sasquatch. Since I liked the idea of this outdoorsy golden moss scent so much I ordered one for myself too. The soaps arrived loose in a USPS bag with some corners crushed in.. i hope I don't hear about that on Xmas morning :( And, they are a bit smaller than I would like for the price of it (roughly 3"" x 3"" x 1"") :( However, the scent is very nice and 'medium' in comparison to a typical national store soap brand. I will consider buying more, but hope Dr. Squatch works on their shipment style and overall value.",3,2014-12-16 04:00:00+00:00,109191402

Alas she is yet to arrive, which, all things considered is probably a good thing. Right now my wife is enjoying the way your soap makes me smell, and I'm afraid another woman would somehow lessen the pleasure. For her. Great soap, although the 80 grit sandpaper you included in it seems a bit coarse for my old skin. Easily solved with a scrubby thingy. A manly scrubby thingy, made of drill grindings.

True,The best part of waking up is koala kisses in your cup,Eucalyptus Greek Yogurt,"This soap meets all of my 'squatch-pectations'. The Eucalyptus is very therapeutic and really opens your airways.

Remember bar soap lasts longer when you use a washcloth or sponge and always use your soapsaver.",5,2014-12-22 04:00:00+00:00,109191328
True,"Bark sniffin', mitt scrubbin', Pine Tar miracle bar.",Pine Tar,"I love the aroma of this soap and the abrasive sand exfoliate. The only downside (which is that of all pine tar soaps) is the grey residue that is left behind in the form of spots on the shower wall and streaks running down the tub. It's probably not a big deal to most people but I'm a clean freak and also have roommates I have to consider. So this soap isn't a choice of mine for showering. As a hand soap however... LOVE IT! It scrubs away grease, dirt, grime, wood glue, black mud, tracker dye, and anything else you can throw at it. The scent is a bonus that lingers for a long time. I've been using one bar of the Pine Tar for 3 weeks now, washing my hands at least twice a day and it has only lost about a third of its mass.",5,2014-12-22 04:00:00+00:00,109191256

True,Arrrgggghh to the shower with ye olde spicy devil!,Bay Rum,I'm not very familiar with your typical bay rum scent but DR.SQUATCH's Bay Rum bar has a really great aroma. Spicy and sweet with a pleasant hint of patchouli. Soap lasts longer when you use a washcloth or sponge and is gentle enough on your skin to wash your hair and face.,5,2014-12-22 04:00:00+00:00,109190870
True,"Aloe, I Love You. Won't you tell me your name?",Cool Fresh Aloe,This bar has a fresh flowery yet mellow scent. It leaves my skin feeling very smooth and is a fine substitute for shampoo.

True,Decent,Pine Tar,"This is a good quality soap, it leathers well and leaves my skin feeling soft. However, the sand and oatmeal make it very rough, it goes away fairly quickly, and while it does smell like pine, the scent is not especially strong and you are not left smelling noticeably like pine after using it.
Bottom line: good soap, but not as strong as advertised.",4,2014-12-22 04:00:00+00:00,109191256
True,Cedar Citrus,Cedar Citrus,"First off, the Cedar Citrus smells amazing! It's a very nice mix of cedar, citrus, and an almost buttery type smell. I bought it right before Christmas so it reminds me of a nice crisp Christmas tree, but more on the side of manly than sparkly snow. 
 
The feel, it leaves my skin nice and hydrated unlike the commercial brand soap I was using before Dr. Squatch. A mild exfoliant won't tear you to shreds but at the same time gets the funk of the day off. 
 
Very refreshing, manly smell and a good clean! 10/10 will be buying more of the Cedar Citrus!",5,2014-12-22 04:00:00+00:00,154635089

True,One of the best soaps I have ever purchased,Pine Tar,"Superb natural fragrance and lather. Great for exfoliation or scrubbing dirty beards! Absolutely a favorite. I've purchasing a variety of natural soaps and this is one of the stand outs. What I love is that it wakes you up, a great soap for a morning shower or to get off late-night grim. Also, it moisturizes so it doesn't dry out your skin. Great product, simple as that.",5,2014-12-23 04:00:00+00:00,109191256

True,The Real Deal,Cedar Citrus,"How often do you buy a men's soap or bodywash with a name like ""Cedar Citrus""--and get something that smells synthetic (and overly strong), or nothing like the name suggests, or overly ""manly""--like someone dunked a navel orange in PineSol and Axe? Not this soap. It's all natural--you can smell only the natural ingredients (literally cedar and citrus oil) and that's it for aroma. Smells great, great lather. And the scent lasts almost all day. This is is the best smelling pine/citrus product I've ever used and (as usual with Doctor Squatch) is a top notch soap.",5,2014-12-23 04:00:00+00:00,154635089

True,smells awesome but expensive,Cedar Citrus,"My only complaint is that you advertise your soaps as designed to last for a month, they definitely do not last that long i used the entire bar in 2 weeks and that was only showering once per day. 
 
I feel like you need to get more soap for the price or it should be cheaper for what you get. 
 
Aside from that you have a great product but I cant justify the price for how long it lasts",3,2014-12-25 04:00:00+00:00,154635089

True,"So far, so good",Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"the bar of pine tar soap lasted just over a week and kept my skin moist in the most dry conditions. 
I feel clean afterward and not greasy. I would like the scent to last a bit longer and have a rectangular shaped bar instead of a square since the square bar breaks in the middle once it gets to 3/8 inch or so.",4,2014-12-25 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Good soap...for men,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I got 4 different scents, mainly because my wife had mentioned all the chemicals in store bought soaps.

True,Aroma Therapy in a bar,Cedar Citrus,"Medium-strong and pleasing scent, especially in an enclosed shower. Not overpowering, just right. It does a fine job of it's primary function, cleaning your body. The skin is not dried out after using the soap.

True,Beyond expectations,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,I bought the multi-soap box as a Christmas gift for BF and was delighted at what showed up. The soaps were neatly packaged in an adorable (or handsome since its men's soaps?) wooden box. The delicious smelling soaps were also emanating a wonderful scent even through the mailing package. BF loved it and declared he's even keeping the box. Who knew soap could be such a good gift? Or I guess as long as it's coming from Sasquatch.,5,2014-12-30 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Smooth citrus with a bit of pine,Cedar Citrus,"I've had three cedar citrus bars from two separate orders. The first bar had a lot more of a piney cedar smell, similar to the pine tar soap, with a bit of orange aroma. The second order I received had a slightly different smell to them. There was more of a citrus smell with just barely a hint of cedar. These bars from the second order also had a more mellow scent to them, even when I lathered them up they were less aromatic than the first batch. Still left my skin feeling very clean without feeling dry.",5,2014-12-30 04:00:00+00:00,154635089

True,Pine Tar is awesome,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I ordered several soaps from Dr. Squatch in an effort to test them all and decide which one to re-order or to just scrap the entire idea of ""Hand-Made Men's Soap"" the first one I tried was Pine Tar, which looks quite similar to a cube of heavy tar with flecks of sawdust peppered throughout. At first it seemed a little rough, rubbing the bar on my bare skin felt like dragging heavenly 100-grit sandpaper all over my body. Naturally I wasn't in the shower alone, and my girlfriend decided to try out Pine Tar as well, she winced ""ouch! It hurts!"" When I read that this soap was ""exfoliating"" I felt that it was a little foo-foo, so let me re-phrase that claim. This soap (in one session) removed the accumulated blood, sweat, automotive grease, and grime from my latest differential re-build, bringing my skin down to its natural form. It was invigorating. Also, the smell. After one shower my one bedroom apartment took on the glorious smell of a carpentry shop. I will be ordering Pine Tar again. I still have five more soaps to try out, but I'm not sure anything can compare.",5,2014-12-30 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,I Love How My Guy Smells,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"My boyfriend had been gifted the Pine Tar soap a few months back and we were both hooked after one whiff. Unfortunately, I was forbidden to use his precious soap, with him even going as far as to hide it from me come shower-time. This holiday season, I purchased nearly the entire line AND the gift set for him. The set was bespoke; four hand-selected bars carefully arranged with the scents I had chosen in a pretty dapper cigar box. Each fragrance is distinct, balanced and clean- I am hard-pressed to find even one I dislike in the slightest. Lately, he has been favoring Spearmint Basil, which does... things to my insides ;) He has managed to hide even these nine bars from me, so awkwardly sniffing him will have to suffice for the time being.",5,2015-01-01 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,"Not quite Gold Moss, but still great.",Driftwood,"Don't let the label of ""cologne"" fool you, this is something totally different than what you are used to. Where boutique colognes tend to be complex and wildly unique, Driftwood is very blunt and somehow gently in-your-face. This is a scent for a simple sort of man who wants his admirers to feel like they are relaxing in a classic American log cabin instead of in a boardroom full of European suits. 
 
The bottle is small, but the scent in the oil is so strong that you don't need but a drop to rub between wrists and on neck to be surrounded in a cloud of warm, citrusy wilderness with a hint of spice. I would describe the scent as sandalwood and spicey grapefruit, with the strong presence of the sandalwood giving way to the grapefruit as time goes on. The strength of the scent seems to wane after 4 or so hours, but it doesn't completely go away for much longer. Basically par for the course with other colognes, though I'm applying a fraction of what I would have to apply with my old Armani to get this presence of scent. 
 
I like that it's all natural oils. I like that I don't smell like a frat boy or a french businessman. Use at your own risk, you may find older women start to call you ""daddy"" once this is applied.",5,2015-01-02 04:00:00+00:00,384842892

True,A Most Godly Smell,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"Definitely must say the smell in amazing! I literally could smell it through the shipment packaging! Though must say the way you ship your products is most unsatifatory! I was sent three bars of soap in a flat rate bubble envelope, not box. The post office charged me to simply get this package, I should not have to pay extra for a package I already paid shipping for! A small flat rate box is basically five dollars and I paid six dollars. I know you want to make a good profit because lets face it, you do have a really good product but your shipping needs upgrades. I will be sending a photo of the packaging to proof I did have to pay an addition feed.",4,2015-01-04 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,"I smell so manly - - it's been validated by strangers, true strangers",Gold Moss Scrub,"I am a Gold Moss Scrub man. It's clear that not only does my shower smell nice, fresh and very manly, I am too smell manly. Very manly. Everyone is now clearly confused by my fresh and manly smell. I've been told by the cadre of sniffers around me that I am reminiscent of the two manly actors Denzel Washington and Steve McQueen. And I don't disagree. 
 
This is great soap, leaves you feeling clean, and for those of us that hate that itchy winter, dried out skin-experience, it doesn't make your skin ashy. 
 
I'm going to the break room to fill up my water bottle here at work. It's really just a rouse to receive compliments on just how great I smell and how clean I look on my way there. I think I'll take the long route.",5,2015-01-08 04:00:00+00:00,109191402
True,soap saver... meh,Soap Saver,"The first soap saver I got was cracked. I contacted the company and they immediately shipped a new one. No muss, no fuss, excellent customer service. The soap saver itself is mediocre at best. The soap sticks something fierce and bits pull off when trying to pry the soap from the saver. When the soap gets down to around a 1/4 inch it falls apart while trying to separate it from the wooden saver. I like the idea, but execution definitely leaves something to be desired.

True,Perfect Soap- 100%,Gold Moss Scrub,"1. This soap smells amazing. Not only do I love it, but my lady cant get her nose away from my neck to smell it. Score!

2. This soap will make your skin perfectly healthy. I have loads of tattoos on my arms and legs and ever since I started using this soap my tattoos shine like new. 

And 3. This soap lasts forever. I didnt want to spend $6 on one bar of soap but I have been using my first bar for about a month and a half (yes, i shower every day) and its not even half gone. 

So to recap: smells great, makes your skin hydrated and healthy, and lasts forever. 

I will use this stuff until the day I die.",5,2015-01-18 04:00:00+00:00,109191402

True,This soap is a BLAST-squatch! (*rimshot*),Cedar Citrus,"This soap is hands down fantastic. Saw it on my first nervous sojourn into the land of Birchbox but they were out of the Pine Tar, so I instead went right to the Sasquatch site itself. I got Pine Tar, Cedar Citrus and Gold Moss Scrub.

True,"Bigfoot hates baths, Yeti loves The Sasquatch Soap Co.",Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"See what I did in the title, pretty clever… Nah who am I kidding, that's not even remotely funny, unless you think it is, in which case that's exactly what I was going for. Seriously, let's get to the soap review. I purchased the Bay Rum because that has always been my favorite scent in any soap. Dr. Squatch has a great soap here. I can't believe how clean I feel, and my skin is so soft, like lose my man card soft. It's such a great way to start my day. Normally I roll around and put off getting out of bed until the last second, but recently I have been up early because my morning shower is refreshing and get's me ready for the day. Mama Squatch says I smell good too, which is great. Little squatches keep sneaking my soap out of the shower, however they are not smart squatches because their smooth skin and great smell tips them off every time. I think I'm either going with the sampler pack next or the monthly delivery, this stuff is perfect.",5,2015-01-22 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,"Great exfoliant, but smell doesn't last",Pine Tar,"I never considered myself to have sensitive skin, but at times it felt like I was washing with sandpaper in my shower.

True,Hardcore clean,Pine Tar,"Not for the faint of heart, Pine Tar is eye-opening and refreshing. Be prepared if you use the bar directly on your skin, as its rite of passage like walking on broken light bulbs or swallowing fire -- the sand in the bar is closer to gravel. Say goodbye to dead skin, and maybe a layer or two of the good stuff. But there's something very rewarding about using Pine Tar that starts my day off right. Like, if I can get through that, I can tackle anything this day can throw at me. Highly recommend.",5,2015-01-29 04:00:00+00:00,109191256

True,Manly Heaven,Pine Tar,"i absolutely love this soap. I got Bay Rum, Pine Tar and Gold Moss. I've been using the Pine Tar but haven't had a chance to try the others.

True,I need an excuse to shower more often,Pine Tar,"This soap is something else. It smell incredible and it makes you and your bathroom smell incredible.

True,Cool product -- pack it better!,Soap Saver,"The soap saver is a cool product. It does a great job keeping that scummy leftover layer off of the surfaces in the shower. 
 
ONE THING: put an extra later of bubble wrap around it or start packaging it in a padded box if it own!! It was snapped in two when it got to me. It was easy enough to glue together, but immediately after pulling it out of the package I knew why it wasn't still in one piece. It's extremely delicate. Take precautions. 
 
Overall a good product. Nice fresh smell and helps keep things clean, but it is fragile and should be packed as such.",3,2015-02-02 04:00:00+00:00,113623428

True,Soaps,Gift Box,I like the soaps a lot. Love the package too. I do think for $6.00 a bar I am struggling to see the value in them but I do like them. I have used 2 bars so far and enjoy the scents and the exfoliating feel I get from them. They last about 10 showers but when it comes down to it not something I would buy on regular basis but would like to have on occasion. As much as I enjoy them I do not see spending $25.00 plus a month on soaps. I think you have a good product but I just don't have the budget to buy regularly.

First i have not received my order yet so i cannot review the product itself. Secondly, The reason for only 4 stars and not 5 is because when one of the products I ordered was on back order, I did not receive any notification that delivery would be behind schedule. It was left up to me to contact you to figure out what was going on with my order. In my own opinion, this should not be something a customer should worry about, they should be informed as early as possible that something has not gone as planned and the product will be shipped at a later time. Besides that the website is very easy to use as well as good descriptions of products to allow you to choose what may suit you best. Once I was in contact with customer support, they were very friendly and responded to me in a reasonable time frame and let me know exactly what was going on, while giving me options to help with getting my product here as quickly as possible.",4,2015-02-17 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Smell like a man.,Hemlock Trail,i went into a drug store the other day and decided to check out the colognes. The lady who helped me had me sample all the ones that were her favorites and I noticed a trend. They were all feminine smelling. i asked her if maybe she was mistaken and these were actually the womens perfumes but she insisted that they were for men. I ended up having to purchase a bottle of whiskey and pouring it on myself to cover up that feminine odor. There were none of these problems with Dr. Squatches Hemlock Trail.

Doesn't bother me, in fact it's kinda cool if color matters for a soap. Unfortunately the smell seems to disappear after I dry off and leave the bathroom. Why only 2 stars? I've used it for a week and it's almost gone. But the exfoliating ""oatmeal"" isn't like any oatmeal I've ever seen. Pretty sure it's actually gravel, and it's way too rough - it's way rougher than any Lava or other gritty soap that I use in the garage. Guess I'm not man enough.

On a side note I had a touch of chlorine rash the other day. Scrubbed it away with the Pine Tar soap. It hurt like hell but the rash was gone in the morning. If none of that has convinced you perhaps telling you that wave upon wave of girls have been flocking to me since I started using this soap. Ok, that last part isn't true but I wanted to sound like some other reviews for this soap. 
 
In all seriousness though, this is a quality soap with natural exfoliants and a great smell. I recommend it. If you are a person that takes a strangers advice over the internet then you should buy this soap.",5,2015-02-22 04:00:00+00:00,109191256

True,"5 star scent, 3 star longevity",Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"Ordered one bar of pine tar and one bay rum. Plenty of other reviews have gone on at length about the intensity of the pine tar. The pine scent is crazy-potent and the exfoliants are like 20 grit sand paper and crushed glass. Great if you need to take off a year of grime and dead skin. Otherwise? It might be more than you need. This might not sound like a glowing review, but the fact is? Coarseness aside? I like the bar. I was just a bit surprised to see how rapidly it diminished. somewhere around 8 - 10 showers in, it was a thin shadow of its former self. Coming from a different brand of hand-cut soap sold in 3.5 oz cubes that survived a month+ in my shower? I guess I expected more from the larger Dr. Squatch bar. Seems like the oatmeal and sand combine to make the bar less dense, so it just goes a lot faster. As for the Bay Rum? I just switched over to it. Love this scent (as does my wife - much more so than the Pine Tar). In fact, I like it enough so sign up for a subscription. Time will tell if it outlasts the pine tar!",4,2015-03-02 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,swing and a miss,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I wanted to love this product - my fraternity brother started it and I like the idea of it being so natural - but unfortunately I had to throw out both bars after a few days.

What I mean is, after I'm done using the Squatch soap (loving it, highly recommend the soap) I place it in the saver. When I come back the next day, I have to pry it off the saver because it's stuck to it so much. I have chunks all over the saver from where I ripped the soap off. Not sure if this is a bad item, or the way it works for everyone, but very disappointed because for $15, it should not be eating my soap!",1,2015-03-06 04:00:00+00:00,113623428

Very coarse ( I don't use the bar directly on my face) kind of wish was it was a bit more fine and spread out more evenly.

 Will definitely be on my next order!!",5,2015-03-07 04:00:00+00:00,109191256
True,Had a bad experience...,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"My bar of soap arrived in a padded envelope but looked like someone sat on it and broke it. The smaller pieces of soap deteriorated rather fast when i used it. Im not sure what the rough particles were in the soap but they literally scraped skin off of me. The smell of the soap was great! But it only lasted while the soap was lathered. As soon as i was dry the smell of the soap was gone. To me, the nine dollars for the soap and shipping just wasnt worth it. Im really hoping that maybe i just got a bad one by accident. I havent tried any of the other products but are still open to them. Probably wont buy another soap anytime soon.",2,2015-03-08 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

It doesn't last long at all, the smell goes away right when you step out of the shower and the price of each bar is just stupid! $6 plus tax plus $20 shipping plus $21 C.O.D. charge to get it across the border. Ended up paying close to $20 per bar of soap when it was all said and done. That is just INSANE! Never buying any of these products again.",1,2015-03-10 04:00:00+00:00,154635089

True,After two months of training,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"After two months of training with the US Army down at Ft. Polk, Louisiana, I came home to upstate NY to find your product waiting on my doorstep. I had heard about your product from an online source and was intrigued by the mountain/woodsy scents and inspired by the quirkiness of your company so I placed an order. After two months of very infrequent bathing, dirt accumulation under the finger nails, and a stench so raunchy my dog wouldn't come near me, your product definitely did the trick. I'm definitely going to be a repeat customer and eagerly await what new products you guys will come up with. Keep Killin it.

True,It's the soap I deserve,Pine Tar,"I've been on the lookout for a piney soap for a long time now, and while I could theoretically take the ole' floor approach and bathe in Pine-Sol, I've heard industrial cleaning products are generally unhealthy for the skin. In comes Dr. Squatch. 
 
It's exactly what I was hoping for. It's a crisp pine smell that's not overbearing, and seems to exfoliate the skin. Though I admit that as a man using pine scented soap, I don't really and shouldn't know exactly what that means, but I definitely feel the bar grinding the grime off me with a deep, dark lather. 
 
Even the customer service is great. USPS claimed to not be able to deliver my package, and within a day, Dr. Squatch already had another package in the mail. USPS eventually delivered my original package, but Dr. Squatch refused to accept a return. I'll be smelling good for a while, thanks!",5,2015-03-11 04:00:00+00:00,109191256

True,Needs reformulating.,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I loved my pine tar soap. It cleans wonderfully, however I found that it simply did not last long enough to be a viable purchase. The bar went quickly, and by the end of one week of moderate use it was a gloppy tarry mess. If I was to come back as a customer it would be because the bars were reformulated to be more ""solid"" and not deteriorate so quickly.",3,2015-03-16 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Good Stuff,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"Ordered the Gold Moss and Pine Tar soaps and both smelled great and got the job done. Got a sampler of the cologne too. There is not much difference in smell between the two, so don't spend a lot of time trying to decide which flavor to buy. Both smelled like trees. I would say they are more suitable as beard oil, since the smell does not linger very long on the skin.

True,Gold Moss Review,Gold Moss Scrub,"I really want to like this soap more than I do. The smell is great, but almost non-existent after about half an hour. I also love the marketing strategy and the all-natural, manly, wilderness vibe of the brand. The soap itself, however, seems to be withering away rather quickly and I haven't quite had it a week (and no, I don't bathe extremely frequently). I just wish the soap, and the smell, lasted as long as other similar products I've used. Maybe it's just the Gold Moss Scrub, but I figured the ""Most Popular Scent"" was a good first bet.

True,Only soap I will ever buy!,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"Dr. Squatch soap is great. I have only used one of the bars (Cedar Citrus) and I wasn't a fan at first, but it smells manly and the soap itself feels great on my skin and really makes it feel soft and nourished. What I think about the scents are completely opinionated, but they do all smell amazing. Golden Moss is probably my favorite. Being a guy that never really cared about what soap I use, this really opened my eyes. The cost is comparable when you think about it, since these bars are more ounces than the typical box store brand. I see no problem paying more for a quality product!

True,Not what I expected,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"It's soap. It'll clean the dirt off. Despite a hint of the scent you are trying to get, it still reminds me of a bad candle store where you try to hold your breath long enough to get back to the door, just not as bad. I've used the citrus bar and pine bar a few times each. I hate to waste the money by throwing the bars away but not really looking forward to using them anymore either.",2,2015-04-06 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,potentially good soap but....,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I can't really say much about the soap as it has been two weeks and I still have not received it. The tracking information said it was misdelivered, then rerouted and listed as 'undeliverable'. I imagine it was trashed in transit or lost. I emailed the dr squatch folks on friday 4/3 and have not heard back. Hopefully dr squatch will send another bar of pine tar cause it sounds like good stuff.

True,Great Quality Leaves Me Feeling Great,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I have enjoyed my first week of using Dr. Squatch Pine Tar soap. The smell is subtle at first, but later seems stronger after the smell from the shower emanates into the rest of my apartment. I enjoy the exfoliating elements, which make it feel like I'm getting extra clean and scrubbed down. I think it will last at least another week, but I anticipate it will not last much more than two weeks, as the bar is fairly small. I'm strongly considering signing up for one of the subscription plans. This is a product that I just feel so good about because it is all-natural and has a good scent. I would highly recommend, potentially higher after I try more of the scents. Smell like a natural man!",5,2015-04-06 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Not pleased with this product.,Soap Saver,"I will start by saying that I love the soap. Will be getting more for sure. The soap saver though is no good at all.

True,Soft and simple,Gold Moss Scrub,I love the scent of this soap. If they could make an alcoholic beverage that tasted as this smells it would be more manly than any other drink I know. Until then I'll stick to drinking whiskey and secretly smelling myself. It has little to no exfoliation. Rated the same as the Greek yogurt but lacking any real grit to it. Just smooth all around. It's in my subscription list for sure.,5,2015-04-09 04:00:00+00:00,109191402
True,Perfect in every way (except one),Deep Sea Goat's Milk,"I love love love this soap. I get compliments on the scent and I like that it is subtle, but lasting. My favorite is the Gold Moss Scrub.

True,Bay rum and pine tar,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,I just want to start off simple and say I love the bay rum scent. It smells great and has a very smooth lather. Now the pine tar doesn't have too much of a pine scent as others I've tried so it's not the best and it is a little coarse on the skin so you can't apply it too harshly if anything I use it more on my beard than my body.,4,2015-04-09 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,Pine tar soap,Pine Tar,"My 1st purchase of pine tar soap had sand in it, but my 2nd purchase did not. I like both and would like the option to buy either one.

When I gave them to him the first thing he said was he loved the (cigar) box that it came in and that he would've been happy with just the box. I told him to open the box. When he did he looked at me and asked me why I bought him soap. I said, ""Because now you can smell like a man and not some cheap French wh*re."" His wife laughed. Then he started using them. His favorite is the Gold Moss. He's thanked me for them, but his wife thanks me every few days and tells me she loves it when he uses any of the soaps because it turns her on.

True,You are missing out,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"This soap is great. I started out just planning on using it for my beard because I was tired of using something with a lot of harsh chemicals that stripped everything out. After one beard wash, I decided this was going to be my full time full body soap. It leaves you feeling clean without any residue. The smell is great. Not overpowering and not to sweet. It smells like man soap should smell. I'm hooked.

True,It's a breath of fresh air,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"im a soap whore. And I'm not even referring to the fancy stuff. If you've ever known someone to use a particular brand of soap because of sentimental value please tell them they are not alone. I'm a Zest guy till the end of time but this stuff that Dr. Squatch is putting out just pretty much gave me closure on the soap sentiment. If I want to remember my grand parents I'll hang a picture on the wall. I'll never buy another bar of zest again. Now my soap budget has freakin quadrupled, I've had to take a second job.

True,"Whether for yourself or another the gift box is just what the Dr, ordered.",Deluxe Gift Box,A solid collection of soaps. The soap saver tray is doing its job like a champ.

True,More Pine Tar,Pine Tar,I like this soap but I wish it were a bit more fragrant. Could be I'm an old man and there has been some degradation of my olfactory receptors. I'll definitely buy another one and give it another try.,4,2015-04-22 04:00:00+00:00,109191256

True,Great stuff!,Deluxe Gift Box,I'm enjoying the ability to shower and smell like a man afterwards instead of some composition of chemical compounds.

True,Good product; moderate value at $15,Soap Saver,Certainly an attractive storage vessel for my soap AND it absolutely works as described. I dinged the rating because I just can't justify the price for a small strategically cut piece of wood. It is a no-brainer necessity for your soap and the price point probably means they know that too. (Note: they offer it at a discount at $12 add-on when you purchase a soap-sciption). However I do recommend the soap saver.,4,2015-04-27 04:00:00+00:00,113623428

True,first time buyer,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"Heard of your product from a friend, and I thought why not give a natural product a try. I was overly surprised with the great quality for being handmade and and all natural. The exfoliating factor of the pine tar bar will keep me as a customer alone. Can't wait to get back in the shower just to try a new scent. Thanks again, and you will continue to have my business as long as you are open.",5,2015-04-29 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,Pine Tar,Pine Tar,This soap is great! A friend from work told me I should check into Dr. Squatch soap and I am impressed. The Pine tar definitely gets the job done.

True,Manly,Cedar Citrus,"This soap caught my eye instantly, so I bought it. It's my favorite scent from the line up. Growing up in Florida with the smell of citrus all around you, it's reminiscent of that. The cedar is a wonderfully woodsy addition to the soap, and my wife loves it!",5,2015-04-29 04:00:00+00:00,154635089
True,Satisfying,Gold Moss Scrub,"This soap smells manly, cleans great, doesn't dry you out like other bar soaps (none of the dr squatch soaps dry you out)",5,2015-04-29 04:00:00+00:00,109191402

True,Intruiging,Eucalyptus Greek Yogurt,"I was not prepared for the smell of the Eucalyptus Greek yogurt soap. It's one of the barrel chested, bearded man smells that i had to order another bar, highly recommended!",5,2015-04-29 04:00:00+00:00,109191328
True,Intense splash of man!,Hemlock Trail,This is a scent that keeps giving. Strong cedar and brush Smell. Keeps even the most fickle interested in you for atleast half an hour. Highly recomended. Use in moderation.,4,2015-04-29 04:00:00+00:00,384840724
True,Soap Scum Galore,Gold Moss Scrub,"After just using a half a bar of soap I noticed that the shower was showing a terrible amount of soap scum that is very hard to clean up. Also, maybe a coincidence, my drain got extremely slow. The scent of the soap is nice but not very strong. Not disappointed that I tried the soap but glad I only ordered one bar and did not subscribe.",1,2015-04-29 04:00:00+00:00,109191402
True,Quite truly a remarkable soap!,Gold Moss Scrub,"Gold moss scrub soap is truly amazing, and has a distinctive smell that truly is a pleasure to be able to surround myself in. I once viewed showering as a mandatory activity that was just routine and had to be done, but now with this, I see showering as a privilage and truly look forward to it. In addition, is acts like sort of an air freshener in my bathroom and makes the whole place smell just beyond great. I am definitely looking forward to trying out new scents, I believe that Bay Rum will be up next for trying. Shout out to Worsnop for introducing me to these soaps! And thank you Dr. Squatch!",5,2015-04-29 04:00:00+00:00,109191402
True,Be a Man,Soap Saver,This soap makes you more manly then you could ever imagine.....well maybe not but it will make you cleaner then any other soap you have ever used. If you try it and give it a chance I'm sure you will never switch back to anything else!!,5,2015-04-30 04:00:00+00:00,113623428

True,Magic Soap,Gold Moss Scrub,"This stuff is great, before I procured this beast, I was a lowly creature. Sad, scrapping for food and friends. I lived under a bridge, and sometimes frightened children. Then one day as I was chasing the local villagers I happened upon your Gold Moss Scrub. I used it....and now my life has changed. Women can't resist me, the villagers have quit trying to burn me at the stake, and I am now the mayor of Awesomeville. I only fear what happens when I run out of this magic elixir....never stop making this.

Shrek's 3rd Cousin Steve.",5,2015-04-30 04:00:00+00:00,109191402

True,Soap saver and cedar citrus soap,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,The soap saver I just purchased was a bad decision by me. The soap sticks to it very badly so when I remove the soap a good sized piece sticks to the soap saver. I have stopped using it. The cedar citrus soap is o.k. But I like the gold moss scrub better so I will be ordering it when this bar of citrus is used up.,5,2015-05-01 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,"Great smell, love the feel!",Deep Sea Goat's Milk,Ordered this soap for my husband as an addition to the other Dr. Squelch soap that he likes and he ended up liking this one even better. New favorite soap! He says he really likes the smell and how moisturizing but exfoliating it is!,5,2015-05-01 04:00:00+00:00,109191474
True,cedar citrus,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"smells good, but not as strong as I thought it would be; soapy and does not make my skin feel dry (good); should last pretty long; would be better if it also exfoliated a little.",4,2015-05-02 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,The Best bar of soap I have ever used !,Pine Tar,"The Pine Tar soap works perfectly. It cleans and exfoliates and leaves a very clean and natural scent. I have tried so many soaps and now I can finally say that my search is over. My wife is even thrilled because I stay smelling clean all day. Happy wife, Happy Life ! Thank you Dr. Squatch",5,2015-05-02 04:00:00+00:00,109191256
True,Wow I smell good,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,This is really good cologne and the price is just right compared to some other products I have purchased in the past. Check it out for yourself.,5,2015-05-02 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,Best soap ever,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,i found Dr. Squatch on Facebook on a whim. I checked out the website and was intrigued by the woodsy scents of soaps after years of only using body wash. I ordered the pine tar bar and I'll never go back. Their soap is amazing. It smells wonderful and makes my skin feel incredible. I've recommended this product to all my friends.,5,2015-05-03 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,Good not great,Pine Tar,Wished it smelled more like pine rather than a generic soap,3,2015-05-03 04:00:00+00:00,109191256

True,Great Soap - could be larger,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I am more than pleased with the Pine Tar soap - the scent quite strong, but not unpleasant, but it mellows fairly quickly. If I had a quibble, it's that the bars are quite small, and a single bar will be worn away in about ten days. 
 
I absolutely recommend this soap if you're looking to not smell like a chemical factory.",4,2015-05-03 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Great soap!,Cedar Citrus,Outstanding scent! Lathers quickly and rinses away cleanly.,5,2015-05-04 04:00:00+00:00,154635089
True,Nothing special,Pine Tar,"If you want to smell like your floors, this is the soap for you. The scent is more like pine-sol than a woodsy pine smell - I was hoping for something more like your typical pine candle scent. The exfoliants are very sharp and make it impossible to use directly on your skin. The soap itself however is perfectly fine and doesn't leave my skin overly dry or oily. I'll be trying one of the other scents without an exfoliant.",3,2015-05-04 04:00:00+00:00,109191256
True,Some Damn Good Soap,Gift Box,"I found it weird to be excited for...well soap. But truthfully I love getting/trying new things. My old soap used to dry my skin pretty bad, and although it was bearable I wanted something different. I loved the advertisement for Dr. Squatch soaps, the idea was great and it was just what I was looking for. They all smell great! If I had only one gripe, its that the bars don't seem to last very long. I'd recommend this to any dude willing to try a natural soap and wanting to smell awesome.",4,2015-05-04 04:00:00+00:00,110663055
True,Good,Cool Fresh Aloe,I would have given this one a 5 star but it seems to melt much faster than the Pine Tar soap. I do like the scent. It is mild and much less overwhelming than others but I would like it to last at least another week. I was lucky to get 2 weeks use before it all melted away.,4,2015-05-04 04:00:00+00:00,152703295
True,Loving Dr Squatch,Gift Box,Love the packaging. Is a gift that I have not given yet so can not say how great they think it is but it does look and smell great!,5,2015-05-05 04:00:00+00:00,110663055
True,I smell AMAZING,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,I ordered the Pine Tar and it is the greatest soap I've ever used. I have been getting compliments on my scent ever since. Love it. Buying more!,5,2015-05-05 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,Love it,Eucalyptus Greek Yogurt,"I have seen a lot of reviews saying that people only get 3 or 4 washes out of a bar...well, people...it makes enough of a severe lather that you don't need to make contact with EVERY inch of your body with the bar every time. I'm a head-shaver, so I only use the bar on my head, chest, and arms...with PLENTY of clean lather to cover the rest of me left over. Anyway, on to the smell...damn its strong, and REALLY helps you wake up in the morning, and relax at night. Sure you don't smell it ALL day, like people complain about...but how long do you smell like that Irish Spring bar you use after a shower?",5,2015-05-05 04:00:00+00:00,109191328
True,Nifty Soap Saver,Soap Saver,"Neat idea and execution, we'll see how long it holds up.",4,2015-05-05 04:00:00+00:00,113623428
True,"Smells Great, feels even better",Deep Sea Goat's Milk,"this soap smells great and it makes you feel even better. It doesn't have that residue feeling that most soap leaves you with, it leaves you feeling clean and refreshed. Definitely recommended",4,2015-05-05 04:00:00+00:00,109191474
True,excellent quality...,Soap Saver,"excellent quality. Does what it's supposed to. However, you'd sell many more if you could get the price down say $5. $15 for a soap saver is a little pricey. Or throw one in for free if we buy three bars of soap, etc.",3,2015-05-05 04:00:00+00:00,113623428
True,"Good, but not as fragrant as the others",Gold Moss Scrub,"I love Squatch soaps. They're frackin' amazing. BUT, this one...I'd pass on when I make my next order. It's just not fragrant as the others. It's that simple. 
 
Other than that, it's a good soap.",2,2015-05-06 04:00:00+00:00,109191402

True,Oasis Wonderland,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,I bought the Bay Rum as my first bar and look forward to showering every day. Who doesn't feel good about themselves in the morning when you enter an oasis wonderland. When I don't want to wake up in the morning I just remember that when I get out of bed my next move is going to take me to smelling like a man who knows how to fight but chooses not to and instead uses the power of logic and nature to will you into peace and prosperity. That is a man I would like to be and this soap helps me takes steps in that direction everyday. Plus it gets you clean.,5,2015-05-06 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Great product.,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I've bought more expensive soap, and it wasn't quite worth it. Dr. Squatch bars are a different story. Great scents followed by a squeeky-clean feeling have won me over. I recommend these bars to everyone, and as Ron Swanson once said, ""Son, my reccommendation is practically a guarantee.""",5,2015-05-06 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,Cedar Citrus,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I ordered this bar for my boyfriend, and he really liked it. I love the way it smells. I'm not sure how much he uses, but it seems to be running out quickly. Otherwise, pretty great stuff!",4,2015-05-06 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,"Fantastic Smell, Tar in Muh Bath",Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"What a great product! The smell is incredible. I have really sensitive skin and it does seem to dry me out a little bit. But otherwise, it could not be any better.",4,2015-05-06 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Fresh Ideas,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"Bought the fresh gift set for my best friend and had it shipped to another state. He LOVED the manliness of it all. Not only are soaps excellent on his skin, the cigar box was a win for him as well. Next time I'll choose the top rated soaps!",5,2015-05-08 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,"Soap (not the series, but I like that too.)",Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"Bay Rum. Bestest soap ever. Nice scent, lather, and performance. I have other squares to navigate, I don't think those will disappoint. I'm glad I made the switch to Dr Squatch.",5,2015-05-08 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,Pine Tar & Gold Moss,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"The descriptions of these soaps are definitely accurate. Pine Tar is a strong woodsy scent. As far as the oatmeal in the bar goes, it's a huge plus. I have some skin problems and the benefits of this soap were almost immediate. When the bar began to run out I bought another and also picked up the Gold Moss to try out. This bar and it's scent is totally different, but equally great. There's really nothing quite like it, whereas the Pine Tar smells like a fresh cut tree. 

What I really enjoy about both of these bars and any soap from Dr. Squatch is the lack of chemicals. My skin is a lot less itchy and irritated. I've also been able to replace my shampoo with this soap. It definitely does the job without making my hair practically fall out. In just a month it grew back about 3x more than before. I've had this stuff in my eyes too and you can't even feel it. 

Overall the smell is good and long-lasting, the things it does for you skin and hair is incredible, and at $6 it's totally worth it. Chances are if your girlfriend is like mine she'll love it too, and with the leftover sliver of Pine Tar I had left the dog got a good bath with it. 

As a guy living in the Pacific Northwest that spends most of his time in the woods and sand dunes and racing ATV's, I'd say this soap lives up to what it claims and exceeds expectations. There's no reason not to take good care of yourself and smell awesome, and this soap will get you there.",5,2015-05-08 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,Wonderful,Cologne Samples,"These samples were exactly what I was looking for. I didn't know how they smelled and didn't want to commit to a full bottle until I tried them. 
 
They both have a very nice smell and I'll be ordering one soon. Thanks for the product!",5,2015-05-08 04:00:00+00:00,352917973
True,Earthy,Driftwood,This is a cologne for guys who don’t wear cologne. It’s subtle in the way a walk through a forest leaves a hint of nature and fresh air on your clothes. More importantly my lady likes it. Thumbs up.,5,2015-05-08 04:00:00+00:00,384842892
False,Wife doesn't like it. Girlfriend does!,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,When I received the Driftwood Oil I put a little on and came home. The wife took one long smell and said for me to never wear it again. That night I visited my girlfriend and put just a small amount on again and she LOVED IT! Now what? Will the wife know I'm seeing someone else if I come home with it on. What a dilemma. Any suggestions?,3,2015-05-08 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,Pine Tar & Gold Moss Scrub,Pine Tar,Both smell great but the Pine Tar is more abrasive than it needs to be. I like that its meant to exfoliate but sometimes it is extremely uncomfortable due to the sand.,3,2015-05-08 04:00:00+00:00,109191256
True,Manliest Damn Soap Around,Pine Tar,"The Pine Tar soap is by the far the finest bar soaps I've ever scrubbed my body with. The sand serves as a scratchy exfoliant which can be a little rough, but damnit - if it's good enough for a sasquatch, it's good enough for me. I've been using it daily for about a week and about 1/3 gone which means I will easily burn through this soap in 3 weeks on average.

True,"Good soap, just not enough of it.",Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I ordered the pine tar soap, which smells as great as it sounds. Loved the abrasiveness of the soap which made me feel I was getting a really deep clean. The only down side of the soap is that there isn't enough of it. The bar lasted less than two weeks. 
I would definitely purchase a much hardier ""squatch sized"" bar if it were offered.",3,2015-05-10 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

I was left clean, great smelling and feeling INVINCIBLE! Upon exiting the shower, sunshine draped me in its golden rays, and the neighborhood ladies began knocking on my door, and looking at me like their next meal. I was no longer a mere mortal, transformed into a demi god!",5,2015-05-10 04:00:00+00:00,384840724

True,Not my favorite,Pine Tar,"the smell is ok, but between that and the scratchy things in it, doesn't make for an enjoyable shower experience. Unless you're in true need of some exfoliation, I would suggest getting something else.",3,2015-05-11 04:00:00+00:00,109191256
True,"So good, so far.",Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"Reformed shower gel user trying the bar soap thing for the first time since the late 90's. Dr. Squatch seems to have his s**t together. I've only been using the bar for a week and I'm already noticing that my skin has not dried out like it did with the shower gel.

True,Amazing smelling soap!,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,I bought two bars of the Pine Tar soap and couldn't be any happier with. Don't let the name evoke thoughts of the smell of Pine Sol.

True,Solid soap. Okay Scent. Extremely abrasive.,Pine Tar,"Perfect soap if you want to smell like your floors. This has more of a Pine-Sol scent than the woodsy evergreen scent I was hoping for. The exfoliants are VERY coarse, sharp, and as a result, extremely abrasive. I couldn't use this soap directly on my skin without feeling like I was going through a cheese grater. As for the soap material itself, it cleans well and doesn't leave my skin feeling overly dry. Works great. My next bar simply won't contain any exfoliants.",2,2015-05-15 04:00:00+00:00,109191256
True,"Nice scent, but wheres the exfoliant ??",Gold Moss Scrub,"I was looking forward to try this scent, my 4th one from Dr Squatch, because of the reviews.
While I do enjoy the scent of the Gold Moss the exfoliant is non existent!! 
I have tried the Pine Tar with the ""rip your face off"" exfoliant as well as the Eucalyptus Greek Yogurt with a light amount of exfoliants, which so far has been my preference.

Being a diabetic, I believed it was simply something I would have to accept. Moisturizers formulated specifically for diabetisc hadd little or no effect. Being a fan of BIGFOOT since I was a child, I made an ""impulse buy"" of yor Dr. Squatch soap... Thinking it would be more of a conversation item. Boy, was I wrong. Your heavily exfoliating PINE TAR brsnd worked a sincere miracle on my shins. Soft, smooth skin and no dry flaky spots at all.

True,A Great Soap,Pine Tar,"The Pine Tar soap smells great and gives you the felling of walking through a pine forest. I really like the smell of the soap but, I don't think ill be using this one again just for the simple reason that it is to exfoliating for my taste. The soap also rinses of black which shouldn't be a surprise since the soap itself is black; although it doesn't stain the shower.

True,Not what I expected,Cool Fresh Aloe,"The smell is ok. Out of the box it is a bit strong; Almost like Pinesol. Once applied it dulls considerably, leaving nice notes to tickle your nose. The main selling point to this product for me was ""Think of it as an Irish Spring that doesn't dry out"". Unfortunately I have found it not to be the case; Not for me anyway. It actually dries my beard out a lot. Exactly the way Irish Spring dries out my skin as a matter of fact. I have used it twice and have had to condition my beard with regular hair conditioner both times. Shipping time was fairly slow. Did receive order number after my purchase but never recieved a notice of shipment as they said they would. Tried to contact them about it but was left hanging. Waste of nine dollars.

True,Soap and Cologne!,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I've been using the soaps for several months now and have tried about half. The quality of the soap is fantastic. They have great smells that wake me up in the morning! They don't leave a standard grocery store soap residue on the shower door or my skin! I wouldn't say that I've tried a soap that I dislike just some that I prefer over others. I tried the cologne sampler pack and was hooked. They are a great weekend scent that is not over powering and is reminiscent of the out doors. The descriptions on the website pretty accurately describe what you are getting. If you are on the fence try the sampler, more than worth it. All in all I'm thoroughly enjoying my soapscription and cologne. High quality products! Truly glad I found Dr. Squatch.",5,2015-06-05 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,A True Man's Soap,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"Since I can remember, I'm a guy who has used gel body wash. I got a sample of the golden moss scrub, and since then, I've been hooked. My favorite scent by far is the pine tar. It's like reaching into the heart of the oldest pine in the forest, pulling pulp from the middle, and scrubbing yourself anew. As long as this soap is available, I will be a loyal customer.",5,2015-06-05 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,"Good Soap, Nice Cologne - Shipping leaves some to be desired.",Cologne Samples,"I recently purchased the Pine Tar Soap, and Cologne Samples. The soap is great! Has an awesome scent, gritty exfoliating sand, and leaves you feeling clean. I'm not a fan of the Driftwood cologne, smells like an old smoker to me. The Hemlock Trail on the other hand, is divine. It's exactly like walking through a pine forest - it's great. Lastly, shipping is $6 no matter what you buy - which I'm not sure I understand, why not just make the bars $7.25 and offer free shipping? I know there are better ways to ship than UPS. At any rate, it's pretty good, I think I'll be buying more Pine Tar soap, but I'll order a lot at a time to avoid spending crazy amounts on shipping.",4,2015-06-09 04:00:00+00:00,352917973

True,"Great soap, but grandma scent",Deep Sea Goat's Milk,"After using a bar of cedar citrus as a beard soap, I recently purchased all the other scents (except Bay Rum) so I could experience all the Dr. Squatch offerings (I will likely review all the scents). I have to say that the soaps are great. I use it primarily on my beard and occasionally on my body. I never feel dried out or covered in a film. I wash my beard at least once a day, and Dr. Squatch soaps help keep it from feeling like hay. The base soap of both scents I have used has been great; I would give the soap five stars. I cannot say the same about the scents.

I would not say Deep Sea Goat's Milk is an earthy men's fragrance. It is very floral. What I pick up most is something along the lines of lavender. This is not to say that men cannot enjoy floral scents; it is 2015, and everyone knows anyone can enjoy whatever they want.

While the description of the scent here says, ""Earthy and Creamy"", I only get a flowery aroma. It is similar to my grandmother's potpourri or a free perfume sample you might get in a Kohl's catalog. Not great and not what I was expecting.

Summary: Soap = five stars; Scent = -1",2,2015-06-10 04:00:00+00:00,109191474
True,"Great soap, good scent",Cedar Citrus,"This was the first Dr. Squatch soap I got. I use it primarily on my beard and occasionally on my body. I have to say I was very pleased. The soap lasted a reasonable amount of time (using it mostly on my beard). I never felt dried out or covered in a film. I wash my beard at least once a day, and I think this soap doesn't leave my facial hair feeling like dried leaves. I recently ordered most of the other scents to try them out. I just started the first of those (Deep Sea Goat's Milk...not a great scent as my review suggests), and the soap quality is just as good.

Cedar citrus is an interesting scent and one that I enjoy. It has a muted and well-rounded orange smell, but the base aroma is that of sweet, damp wood. My apologies if damp wood makes you think mildew. I have used other citrus soaps on the past. While those make you smell like you got a Gatorade shower after winning the Super Bowl or like you had a soaking in a tub if Minute Made concentrate, Cedar citrus has nice complexity and maturity that I enjoy.",5,2015-06-10 04:00:00+00:00,154635089

True,Never turning back,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I wasn't sure what to think about expensive smelly soaps for men, but Dr. Squatch piqued my interest with scents like Pine Tar, Bay Rum, and Spearmint not to mention a four pack in an awesome wooden recycled cigar box. I can honestly say, after going through two bars, this was one of the best decisions I've made as an adult. You won't be sorry (and neither will your significant other).

The soaps are great quality and a perfect size. I ordered 6 different flavours (if you can call it that) and they are all amazing. The green moss scrub is my favourite so far. The soaps lather really well and the scent last a long time.

True,Fantastic Company,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"This is the first review I have ever written; however, this company has caused me to take to my keyboard. The customer service level with Dr. Squatch is fantastic. I will start out by saying I am not a smart man and so I allow the google auto fill function to fill out address's for me. This is when disaster struck, in short it filled out the wrong address and my dreams of manly smells where crushed as my wayward soap made its way across the country to another man. I contacted the Dr. Squatch customer service and when I explained my tragedy, they quickly sent out a new package at no cost to me. I am doubly impressed as I am no long time customer and this was my first trial run with Dr. Squatch. I have since used the soap that was sent to me and I believe my sex appeal doubled and I have had to begin carrying a stick to beat women off of me. This is doubly impressive as it feels good to use this soap in the shower. On a serious note this company rocks and their soap is fantastic and their customer service is top notch.

True,Very nice,Pine Tar,"I bought this soap expecting it to last maybe 3 weeks, but it lasted almost double that. This is by far my favourite of all your soaps (all of them are nice!), and it seemed to last longer as well (maybe the oatmeal or something?).

True,Dear Dr Squatch,Cologne Samples,"Well my dear Squatchers in Squatchland.....you have made me into the squatchman I was always supposed to be. I've only been able to use the Pine tar soap, but in combination with either colognes, well ladies and gents, it is a doozy. I'm being smelled at the office, at parties, being passed around getting hugged since people are so curious at what permeates from my body. Like I read when I first was investigating the good Dr, look good feel good, and that starts from the skin up. I've used so many different body soaps (both bar and liquid) over the years and was still plagued with dry irritated skin. Not anymore. And since it's so kickass anyways I use it as shampoo and face wash....and my skin or hair have never felt better. No more dry skin. It feels softer and healthier. So the only real comment I have, oh Squatchers, is when will you come out with a deodorant? 
I enjoy changing scents on a daily basis and since it's oil based it seems to stay on longer than most all the other colognes I've spent too much money on. 
Ya'll have a Squatcher for life. Good work and PLEASE keep it up. Squatch out.",5,2015-07-07 04:00:00+00:00,352917973

True,Manly soap for the squatch in us,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,I got this soap as a present but it went way beyond the normal 'give a smelly guy a smell-good gift'. This soap rocks!,5,2015-07-17 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,soap review,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,I have only used one bar out of the four and that was the eucalyptus-yogurt bar. Its OK. Nothing special and lightly scented. I was sort of hoping for a bit more eucalyptus scent. ALso have tried the Driftwood cologne and I like it (its for those who don’t typically were fragrances) however the girlfriend is not too hot for it. I look forward to trying the other 3 bars of soap soon.,5,2015-07-17 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,Great stuff,Dr. Squatch Favorites Bundle,All the soap was great but the pine tar is my favorite .,5,2015-07-17 04:00:00+00:00,372598912
True,Where has Squatch been all my life?,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I have always been a clean guy, but Dr. Squatch soaps take clean to a new level. My skin is wicked clean but not filmy or dried out from this soap. Pine Tar is masculine at its best and the exfoliation is just right. Gold Moss is a gem of a bar of soap. I'm sold. I'm a Squatch guy from now on.",5,2015-07-18 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Best guy soap ever!,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,Found this soap by accident... ordered a few bars just to see. My husband loves them all. My favorite is the the Bay Rum.

True,Excellent soap,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,ive only used the pine tar soap thus far but ordered a few more different kinds. Great change from body wash,4,2015-07-19 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,A Classic,Pine Tar,"Regrettably, I never got into baseball as a kid; nevertheless, Pine Tar brought back boyhood memories the minute I opened the box. There was a great old barn-turned-rec-center at a summer camp I attended and later worked at. The wood in that building was sealed with pine tar. I never knew what that classic scent was until I caught a whiff of this soap and was taken right back to some of the best summers of my life. I'm NOT saying you'll smell like an old barn if you use Pine Tar--this soap has a wonderfully refreshing, pungently sweet, but not overpowering scent. I am saying this soap packs an aromatic punch that evokes good ol' times of summers playing in the forest and spent at camp. Since the cigar/gift box arrived from Dr. Squatch, I've looked forward to hitting the shower each morning and really waking up with this ruggedly invigorating soap. It not only serves its primary purpose well--lathering up and cleaning great; it's also provides a (welcomed!) daily dose of thoroughly manly aromatherapy. There's a reason this is their best-seller; it's a classic. If you haven't tried it, don't put it off any longer!",5,2015-07-19 04:00:00+00:00,109191256
True,A Real Man's Fragrance,Hemlock Trail,"This is the manliest cologne…EVER. Of mainstream fragrances, it most closely resembles Drakkar Noir, but it has a much earthier, woodsier soul. It smells less refined—in a good way: clean but not soft, wild and yet sophisticated. It’s at once natural, essential, and complex. It hints of adventure and maturity, primal urges and quiet strength. I use this mostly in my beard—just a little bit after my morning shower and shave. It refreshes and it stirs. It awakens something deep, exudes authentic masculinity, and conveys subtle but unmistakable confidence.",5,2015-07-19 04:00:00+00:00,384840724
True,Awesome soap.,Pine Tar,"I generally buy scent less soap, because I don't want to smell like a woman. Dr Squatch's Pine Tar is virile, it will bring out your inner man, like the woodsman you are supposed to be, I don't think I'll use anything else, period.",5,2015-07-20 04:00:00+00:00,109191256
True,Loved it,Pine Tar,out if the 3 I got it was by far my favorite ! I was not disappointed but thought I'd like the gold moss more didn't really have a scent to me .

All joking aside, I seriously love your guys' products. How great is it that a product is made in the USA, very much affordable, and is a great smelling product for us guys? (not that your products are for men only, my girlfriend loves the smell of them too!) My favorite is the Deep Sea Goats Milk... although the gold moss scrub is a close, close second. 
 
Here's a testament for your product: 
I'm a blacksmith/bladesmith. I create things of steel, some being very sharp. I spend hours on top of hours working beside a hot coal forge, sweating with every hammer blow. When I finish working, I have black soot and grime all over me from the coal and metal. This stuff not only smells good, but it helps me scrub away all of that dirty crud and leave me clean, refreshed, and smelling dang good. Forever a lifelong customer.",5,2015-07-20 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,"I like them both, but I like being in the woods too",Cologne Samples,"My wife says the scents are nice but not flirtatious like. More of a scent you expect a friend or a family member to smell like. She like a more beach like floral scent. In all i'd say, personally I love them both. Brings me back to thinking about nature, hiking, jeeping, or just chilling along the lakeside. But I don't buy cologne to do that. I buy it so she jumps my bones. I'd recommend this to friends, but it's not going to be a big hit with their ladies unless they love the outdoors to the point that's all they dream about. I'd say it's really more of a 3.75 stars rating. Great scents, but just not the right purpose for my use.",3,2015-07-21 04:00:00+00:00,352917973
True,Awesome,Gold Moss Scrub,Great scent. I sometimes just pick the bar up for an uplift from the smell. Also love the Pine Tar smell.,5,2015-07-21 04:00:00+00:00,109191402
True,Super great manly scent for stepping out the shower,Pine Tar,"Makes you feel like you're bathing in the forest. I love the scent. I also like the Gold Moss too. My only complaint would be I wish I could get this same scent without all the exfoliation or possibly in a body wash. The scent is strong and a great way to wake up, but the abrasive texture makes my hesitate to buy again. But the scent brings me back kind of like wanting to pet a lion. I can't NOT recommend this product, it's just a great product with great ingredients but will do the extreme job of exfoliating if you're sensitive I would recommend Gold Moss instead.",5,2015-07-21 04:00:00+00:00,109191256
True,Awesomest Soaps Evar,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"Seriously though. They smell great, the packaging is amazing, and I feel like the manliest man that ever lived after I step out of the shower. Buy this soap now.",5,2015-07-22 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
False,Do it a little better,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,You have to get better at what you do. My soap came broken because it was sent in a soft envelope. You have to protect the product.

True,Great Sent!,Cedar Citrus,This bar is a fantastic mix of a piney cedar and citrus scent. Doesn’t dry me out like other natural soaps I’ve tried. The only think that I would change would be the shape. Doesn’t exactly fit well in the hand but as far as the actual soap is concerned its damn near perfect.,5,2015-07-23 04:00:00+00:00,154635089

True,Best Decision of my Life,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I, for the longest time used a brand that rhymes with Bold Slice. I liked the smell and the marketing was very clever. I always felt as though these other brands could not compete. My wife and I started to have kids and changed things in our lives including our diets (Gluten Free, Paleo) to her even starting to sell and use essential oils. Then we switched our toothpaste to natural toothpaste. Then she started using natural soap. I was not down with that. She wasn't going to separate me from Bold Slice. But After sometime, I came across your company. ""Manly"" natural soap??? Well, I decided to make a deal with my wife. I will use it and give it a try. She looked at the ingredients used and was on board. I still was in my head, not going to be convinced. But then my order arrived and the smell alone was phenomenal! So The next morning, I used the bay rum bar. My skin never felt so clean and never reacted to soap so positively before. I have had dry, itchy skin for some time now and the first day of using Dr. Squatch Bay Rum, no itch. I smelled good, felt good and I am pretty convinced that I look like Hercules due to your soap. (Well, maybe not the last part.) I am truly convinced that your soap is superior to all others and will only use your product.

True,Purchased Spearmint Basil and Pine Tar soaps,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"While at first I was slightly disappointed with the fragrance of the pine tar soap--It was simply not ""piney"" enough for me--I quickly changed my mind oonce i used the soap for the first time. Never before has the skin on my face felt so smooth and natural, the Pine Tar soap is a real godsend when it comes to exfoliation. If you are someone like me, who has a history of facial blackheads, this may be the soap you've been waiting for. The Spearmint Basic Scrub is another wonderful product--if you like the smell of basil then this is definitely a soap you'll be a fan of. It's got a cool, slightly spicy smell to it and leaves me feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. I would highly recommend both of these soaps to anyone.",5,2015-07-28 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,My soap experience,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"so far, I like the scents, variety, packaging, and overall theme. A bit underwhelmed with the lifespan of the soap, the quality when it gets smaller (breaks too early and becomes useless) and the staining the woods soap saver has in the shower. Looks like the varnish runs for a few weeks before it is gone.

True,Expectations Far Surpassed!,Deluxe Gift Box,"I had wanted to try Dr. Squatch for some time. I took the “Prescription Quiz” and read reviews for the different soaps and colognes. I realized the Deluxe Gift Box was the most economical way to sample it all. Even so, initially I was reluctant to make the investment in this collection of products I’d only seen advertised online. Let me tell you, I AM SO GLAD I DID! The quality of the soaps, the fragrance, and the cigar box far exceeded my expectations. I’ve previously reviewed the Pine Tar soap and Hemlock Trail cologne—both are classic, invigorating, masculine products!—and I’m looking forward to lathering up with the Gold Moss, Bay Rum, and Cool Fresh Aloe soaps that also arrived in the Deluxe Gift Box. (I’ll review them when I get to them—but these bars last a LONG time, which is awesome!) I want to comment here, though, on the box itself, because it’s what raises this from merely a set of outstanding personal care products to the kind of classy, timeless, souvenir that you could give to your groomsmen before a wedding, to your son at a milestone in his young adulthood, or to a father-figure in your life on a very special occasion. Mine arrived in an Alec Bradley Black Market (Toro) cigar box. Solid wood, the box was handmade in Honduras, features an antique-looking metal latch, and is decorated on the inside with faded, Old World-style shipping receipts. Opening the box feels like stepping back in time…, which kind of makes sense when you consider that everything Dr. Squatch makes is handcrafted using natural ingredients and traditional processes. Like everyone else, I enjoy my modern conveniences, but there’s something essential about touching, opening, and breathing in that which is authentic, grounded, and connected to ways of doing things and being in the world that are genuine, time-honored, and altogether worth remembering.",5,2015-08-02 04:00:00+00:00,389049520
True,It was good,Deluxe Gift Box,"the scent a a bit light and pedestrian. I enjoyed the aloe mostly. I asked a friend for their thought on the oil and the response was ""Meh"".

True,Pine tar soap,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I just tried the Pine tar soap for the first time. I will say I like the smell. and the scent it leaves on you after a shower. and yes, it does leave a good scent in the bathroom as well. I will say the bar only lasted me a week. That is something I wanted to find out about, and my only negative thing to say about it. But after a week of using it, I did notice a difference in how my skin feels, and also how it seems to get rid of the ""old man smell"" I think I can now associate with using regular commercial brand bar soap, and the film it leaves on you. I have in the past used a hard mill natural soap before, and liked the way it lasted longer than regular soap. I started using the gold moss scrub tonight, and it has a great smell to it too. I will see how long it will last me, I hope longer than the pine tar, which I think I go through quick because I shower daily, and the exfoliants may make it more porous, but you do get a good scrubbing from it. Ask me in a week or two and I will give you my opinion of the Gold Moss. Now for the rest of my review, I will say this. I deal with people a lot, and I notice a lot of repetition of smells from guys, same type of smell, which seems to me to be overpowering, and I would say metrosexual feminine with no character. So far, I like the unique clean fragrance that doesn't smell like everybody else, and it's far from the overwhelming garbage I smell out there, these guys may as well be wearing tussy lol! I think subtle is much nicer than Hey I'm Here!",4,2015-08-06 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Dr. Squatch Soap Saver.,Soap Saver,"I was sceptical about the soap saver and its ability to adequately save soap, but I purchased it as I had no local options for soap keepers. Hot damn, I was impressed. It's a solid piece of wood, carved and ready for action. Not only does it make my bar of sweet action pine tar soap last longer, it gave me a tactical advantage in a fist fight. Ask the guy with no front teeth and breath with a hint of pine.

This soap really does feel better on my skin after a shower and i love the smells of all the bars of soap that I got in the gift box as well as the box itself. I think they're presentation really matches the quality of product they have made and so far I am really enjoying their soap. 
 
This isn't a negative only preference, but I would say as far as the bars of soap i got, i am not a huge fan of Pine Tar and the Eucalyptus Greek Yogurt only because they're much more coarse on my skin and i wasn't exactly prepared for that. They smell great, but they have sand and other stuff in them, so if you're not a big fan of that, then I would suggest not getting them.",5,2015-08-09 04:00:00+00:00,389049520

True,Why so soon?,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"The pine tar soap is AWESOME!! The only bad part about it was that it was gone just way too soon! It only lasted through 6 showers. $1 per shower. I was a bit disappointed that it didn't last very long, but my skin felt great after the shower. Great product, just wish it would last longer. Maybe that's cuz it doesn't have all the chemicals in it?",4,2015-08-09 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,"Love the scent, love the feel, but hate the short timeframe.",Pine Tar,"I bought this and received it on Thursday. I love the way my skin feels after using it. It is very cleansing and has a similar feel to Lava soap (but without all the chemicals you can't pronounce). The smell was great. I have to admit it took me a couple minutes to get used to it, but it really smells awesome! I would say the downside, and why I can't give it 5 stars is that it doesn't last very long. I got it Thursday (today is sunday), and it already is down like 30% from it's original size. I just wish they could somehow make this one last longer. I assume the oatmeal and sand is why it doesn't last as long.",3,2015-08-09 04:00:00+00:00,109191256
True,I like it but....,Cedar Citrus,Soap smells great but it just doesn't last too long. This does not dry my skin out like most soaps. I use it for both body and face. I do not need the soap saver that they push on the site. My shower rack already has one. I'd buy again for the great product but they could give a bigger bar for what you pay for.

True,The smell is fantastic!,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,I purchased the pine tar scent and it smells like a mountain cross-bred with a pine tree and had soap babies! This soap will completely blow your senses (in a good way) to a whole new level. The reason I gave this 4 stars is because I don’t see anywhere that states if this soap is anti-bacterial or not. I just use my regular anti-bacterial soap first and then I soap up with Squatch. I took this soap out of my mail box and it smelled so good that I could not wait to take a shower….literally.,4,2015-08-22 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Smells like Pine,Pine Tar,"I have used pine tar soaps before, and decided to try this one out. This soap does not have a tarry smell at all. I think the best description would be it smells like a pine candle, but in a good way. It is strong, but not overpowered. I feel truly clean too. The smell dissipates into a gentle scent fairly quickly, which I really appreciated, as I do not like being a walking perfume shop. Dr. Squatch, you have a life long customer.",5,2015-08-25 04:00:00+00:00,109191256

True,"Pine Tar Soap, the best soap I have ever purchased.",Pine Tar,"I have purchased Dr.Squatch soap before,but heard great reviews about pine tar as a great scent and exfoliating soap, specifically for bearded men. When I opened the mailbox, the smell hit me like a truck. It was very strong pine almost like pine sol. Once I opened it up I realized this was definitely some powerful stuff. I had to try it, right away. Me and my wife were arguing lightly about something ridiculous before I hit the shower, when I got out she came in and the smell stopped the argument. She said how much she liked it, even better than the Gold Moss, which was my personal favorite before. I have a full beard,and it softens it and detangles.it doesn't have the long lasting scent I thought it would, at least that I can tell,but it definitely does a great job as far as a beard soap goes. I would recommend this soap to anyone with a longer beard, or who loves the pleasent refreshing smell of pine tar. It does leave a lot of black in the shower, but it rinses right away. The manliest, best working, natural soap I have ever purchased and I will be buying more, my kids love to use it too. Get yours now!!!",5,2015-08-26 04:00:00+00:00,109191256

True,Coast Guard Flight Mechanic Endorsed,Gold Moss Scrub,"I fell in love with this soap after one use. I get covered in sweat, sea spray, oil, grease, grim, and other various hazardous materials all day, every day at work. This stuff left me feeling clean and the smell is fantastic. I was a little hesitant to try a bar soap due to previous experience with drying skin with run of the mill products, but after just having it in the shower for the first few minutes I was hooked. Definitely looking at a long time customer here.",5,2015-08-29 04:00:00+00:00,109191402
True,As good as advertised,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"After reading multiple reviews and learning a little about the company, I decided to try a couple of the products (the Bay Rum and Gold Moss soaps and the cologne sampler as well). These products were all as good as advertised- the very definition of ""getting what you paid for"". I used the Gold Moss as shaving cream and it worked like a charm! My skin felt clean without any of the dryness that I often feel after using soap. The Bay Rum keeps me and the bathroom smelling nice as well. The colognes are straightforward and masculine without being heavy-handed. All in all, I am very pleased by purchase. I hope that Dr. Squatch's line expands to include lotion and aftershave in the future.",5,2015-08-29 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Saves my soap!,Soap Saver,"I love my Dr. Squatch soap, and I want it to last as long as possible. Just throwing them wherever isn't an option for me. I looked at some other fancy soap dishes, but the Sasquatchian size of the bar requires an equally mighty place to store my soap after each use. The Dr. Squatch soap saver fits the bill perfectly. My soaps sit nicely on top of it, and the pleasant smell of cedar from the Soap Saver compliments any bar that I happen to be using at the time. If you've made the investment in the soap, ensure it lasts as long as possible and get yourself a Soap Saver. It's worth it!",5,2015-08-31 04:00:00+00:00,113623428

True,Slightly over rated,Pine Tar,"Scent was not nearly what was expected, tended to be a little weak, but masculine. Exfoliation ability second to none! Durability of the bar was poor.

True,"Great soaps, great scents.",Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I love the scent of the soaps, i also got some of the hemlock grove cologne - its an oil, but pricey and really small. 
 
I still like and recommend the products. It would be great if bars were larger (for price) or it was available via amazon, so i could save on the shipping. 
 
I'm still giving it a high rating because not only are the scents right on the money (but need a new one: sage, oregano and bear haha) and they dont contain ANY poison or unnatural crap. 
 
A natural deodorant from them would be awesome too, i'd buy it.",4,2015-09-05 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Excellent products—poor quality control! :o(,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I like all the products I’ve tried but the quality control seems to be falling apart. 1) I bought a cedar soap holder. It looked like something I could make in my shop in about 2 minutes (rough, crude manufacture & finish) then my soap stuck to it and peeled off the top layers of some of the bars in the form of pungee-stick-like splinters! 
2) Most recent bar of the Pine Tar Soap (my favorite) felt like the abrasive grit was going to take my skin off! (don’t remember the first bar being this rough)

True,Lasted Longer than I thought!,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I ordered the Gold Moss Scrub and the Bay Rum. After reading some of the reviews I was leery about the longevity of the soap. I have just passed 2 and a half weeks with the Gold Moss Scrup and I still have a good week or more worth of soap to go. Overall it is about half the use life I was getting from my store bought brand, but the cleanliness and lasting sent more than make up for what it lacks in use life. I will never go back.

True,I love this soap,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I ordered the Gold Moss Scrub and Bay Rum soaps. After 3 weeks I’m still on my first bar, Gold Moss Scrub. I love the scent, not too heavy. It rinses clean, doesn’t leave you feeling sticky, or dry…I’ve used bar soup specifically for oily skin, or “natural” ingredient that dry the hell out of my skin and leaves it flakey. This soap doesn’t do that. It cleans deep, but leaves enough moisture so my skin doesn’t over produce oil to compensate.

My dad uses it too and he likes it.",5,2015-09-22 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,Good soap. Questionable Value.,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I love this soap! The pine tar and golden moss especially. It's hard to find good quality soap for men and the good Dr didn't disappoint. My only pain point was the size of the bar. It's 5oz. In my opinion that's a chick's size soap bar. For this price it should be larger. At this PP I would expect a bar closer to 10oz. I would pay $10 for a 15oz bar and would keep coming back repeatedly. I remember a decade or so ago when The Body Shop carried something called a ""milk bar"". It was an oversized bar of soap made from goat's milk. It was abut $9 and probably 20oz or so. I cried the day it was discontinued. I hope you continue to grow. It's a great brand.",3,2015-09-23 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Pleased with both use and results,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"This is my first experience with buying and using a bar of soap specifically intended for a beard. The soap performs well from providing an easy lather to rinsing off. It has a pleasant fragrance all its own, but it is not the ""Irish Spring"" scent at all. Best of all, my skin beneath the beard does not get soap residue nor itch. A very positive experience and as a *stand-alone experiment of sorts, I highly recommend it.

I have ordered every single one of their soaps bars now and have no bad reviews at all, you really can't go wrong with any. I even ordered a gift box for myself, why share. Customer service is great too, I ordered the wrong scent of cologne and they swapped it out right away with a simple email. Great natural soap, cool name, and I don't even have to leave my house to get it.

This one, though, is rated as a ""medium."" Out of the package and when it's in use, the bar smells great. But once I'm done with the shower, I can't smell it at all. Granted, I don't smell like fumunda cheese and onions so I guess it's doing the job of cleaning, but there's no lingering scent at all. I expected the scent to be stronger than that of the Gold Moss and was surprised to find that it's basically non-existent.

False,"Difficult to load, but overall great!",Shave Bar,"Dr Squatch's Shave Bar is a unique smelling soap with a great masculine scent of clay, mint and a very nice citrus hint at the end that stays with you after the shave.

During the time of this shave I had two weeks facial hair growth, a new Persona blade in a Phoenix DOC Safety Razor.

I do have to say at the beginning using this soap while blooming it I was almost about to give up, there is a certain way that this soap needs to be lathered. If you fail to lather it in the way that it is designed to you will be very disappointed in the results.

This soap is a very hard soap to lather if you do not know what you are doing. If are used to a wet brush and blooming your soap this soap will cause you to change your habits. This soap does not like excess water, if you use too much water you will be very disappointed to see the result, that result being a foamy lather. When the soap is applied onto the face correctly with minimal water you are going to have to hydrate the soap roughly 45 seconds to a minute in order to keep it as a cream, if you choose not to it will dry out on your face. I also noticed that this soap works better with a smaller boar size brush due to the size of the puck being 4.5 oz. My best result was with an Omega 46065 boar brush with a face lather. I also tried with a 30mm knot Whipped Dog High Mountain Badger brush and a Esccali badger brush, the soap worked great in both a face and bowl lather although I would recommend a bowl lather as it is a lot easier to see the reaction of the soap and add water.

When this soap is loaded correctly the soap is a great soap, with a strong masculine smell and glide that it supplies could be a soap I would turn to on a regular shaving basis. I would be reluctant to use this soap while shaving a longer growth just because of how much attention has to be applied to the consistency of the soap, if there is too much or too less water you will not enjoy the shave. I would not recommend this soap for newcomers to the art of traditional shaving just because of all the factors that come into play. Price of this soap is 12$ for 4.5 ounces that puts the cost as 2.66$ per ounce which is beyond fair in my eyes.

Loading ability of this soap is going to be lower due to just how picky it is for this soap to form a good lather. I will give it a 4 out of 10.

Peaks with this soap are very nice and deserve nothing less than a 8 out of 10.

Gliding ability with this soap is a 7 out of 10.

Scent of this soap would receive a 9 out of 10.

Overall this soap would receive a 7 out of 10.

Of course I always would recommend a good pre-shave to help with the gliding ability.",4,2015-10-07 04:00:00+00:00,946521860

It does an excellent job exfoliating and getting rid of all the odor in the tricky spots like armpits and the crotch. Thanx to Dr. Squatch I have happy crotch !,5,2015-10-08 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
False,"Great soap, awesome smell, feels great!",Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"This soap was amazing. The texture, smell, and quality are all perfect. I have always struggled with a small amount of acne/blemishes on my shoulders and back and decided to finally buy a natural soap to try and help this situation. Dr. Squatch cleared everything up in about 5 days. The grit is just right to rough up the skin and exfoliate, without being painful or abrasive. I hate to follow up such a positive 5 star review with a complaint, but the size is just too small for the price. The one bar lasted me less than 3 weeks. It's possible that I did indulge as I used it to scrub my face and (hairless) head every day too, but even if I could get a full month out of a bar, $9 is a bit too much as a monthly expense for soap. I fully realize that this is a premium product, and the product is fantastic, but it may just be that it's a little out of my budget. Either way, great work Doctor!",5,2015-10-09 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

Contacted Squatch Support, and they were very understanding and send an identical order right away, which arrived without tampering. 
 
The Pine Tar is fantastic, a bit scratchy though. It does leave a residue wherever it sits. 
 
Use a soap saver, as well as a loofah (man up and stop complaining you go through soap too fast when you have easy options like this! dark green and blue ones are a couple bucks at Walmart) to extend the life of this bar, since it is only 5 oz

My kids like to watch me shave with it, because they say it looks cool. Even though I won't let the boys touch my razor yet, I have put some of the lather on my 7yo son's face and he loves the way it smells and feels as much as I do. 

And my wife--the one person I try my hardest to impress--loves the way my face smells and feels after I get done shaving each morning.

False,Soaps I have tried so far;,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"The Bay Rum is my favorite I believe. I really like the smell and so does my wife. She didn't care for the Gold Moss. Using the Bay Rum reminds me of my childhood and getting Old Spice or one of those type products from my old fashioned Great Aunt. I know it sounds corny, but using this soap reminds me of a past when things were more ""manly"". It is a man's type smell and the soap just works so much better for showering than the other commercial made soaps. I used to use Lever 2000, but won't buy any of those again. Dr. Squatch is a superior product to any of the name brand soaps purchased in stores. You step out of the shower feeling good and clean and you smell like a man should. 
My next favorite and very close second is the Pine Tar. I didn't know what to think when I saw the black color but immediately enjoyed the smell and the coarse texture. It is a great soap. I may have to keep two bars in the shower at a time and switch back and forth. The Pine smell is great! Reminds you of the outdoors. (I have an outdoor shower too). The coarse texture reminds me of the old Lava brand soap my father used to keep out on the utility room sink for washing dirty hands. Great scrubbing ability, (we won't use the exfoliation word) or any other feminine terminology. The Pine Tar really cleans well and leaves you feeling fresh when you finish your shower. Awesome product! 
Using the Goats Milk, Sea salt now. I'll fill you in later. I used to have Dairy goats and my wife made a milk soap and would add ground up egg shells for texture, so I'm interested to try your sea salt version. 
Thanks guys",5,2015-10-26 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,Even good for old guys.,Pine Tar,"I avoided this soap for months, thinking it was produced by and marketed to only the younger hipsters with full beards. I'm past 50 now and as far from hip as I can be. I worry about things like death and taxes. But I like to smell good too. I relented and picked up a couple bars. The Pine Tar was up first, and it blew me away. The smell reminded me of my old trout fishing cabin from my youth. Once my reminiscences of a #18 Olive Dun subsided, I realized how fresh and non-filmy I felt. My wife greeted me at the bathroom door (THAT never happens) and said, ""You smell good."" She's smelled me plenty of other ways without commenting, so that was a bit miraculous on it's own. She rubbed my arm and said, ""And you're soft too."" Since my kids might end up reading this, I'll dispense with further annotations. Suffice it to say, I haven't enjoyed taking a shower this much since my teenage years.",5,2015-10-26 04:00:00+00:00,109191256

You need this if you are using bar soap.",5,2012-12-04 04:00:00+00:00,70698419

True,Great Soap albeit scratchy,Pine Tar,"I really enjoy the scent of the Pine Tar soap. It stays around for a long time and has an awesome, masculine smell that both my girlfriend and I enjoy. The scent sticks longest in hairier areas, so my beard ends up having an awesome aroma all day. The only reasons I cannot give it 5 stars is that the soap doesn't quite foam up enough for me compared to the other soap I've gotten from Sasquatch (Cool Water). Also, the particles in the soap can be a bit scratchy, although that came and went depending on what stage of use I was at. 



Even with those slight issues, the scent is above and beyond for me. It has beat out Cool Water, so it's on to Gold Moss Scrub and Bay Rum to see what gets top spot.",4,2013-03-20 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

Seeing the gift idea, I went ahead and ordered it-we were both blown away when it arrived. The cigar box was completely sturdy, and the soap selection was awesome. He loves it, and has requested that once he uses this soap that I order him some more. Its strong enough that it lasts all day, but not over powering in any way. And, as a perk, we live in Utah's high mountains at 7000 feet elevation, where the air is extremely dry...he has not needed lotion to hydrate his skin since he began using the soap.",5,2013-03-26 04:00:00+00:00,81318210

I would then be stuck using non-natural products (or going no showers) until my new sasquatch was being delivered. Soapscriptions that problem away! I splurged for the Deluxe, and my first shipment of 8 bars came in today and it was like Christmas morning!

True,Squatch Saver,Soap Saver,I bought the soap saver to save my soap. It is saving my soap this very instant. It is smaller than it appears in the pictures. There is a faint pine smell that reminds me of pine trees. My beef with the triple S is that the soap sticks to it when it dries. This might stop after a while. I will continue to use the soap saver despite all of this. I really like the soap. I think it softens my skin and leaves me with the perfect amount of moisture.,3,2013-10-03 04:00:00+00:00,70698419

True,Handy just pretty over priced,Soap Saver,"Its handy to have, but is basically a routered section of 2x4. For some reason I thought it would be different. Pretty over priced for what it is.

True,"Great for skin, but do not apply directly to balls",Pine Tar,"This stuff is awesome. I can actually feel the oatmeal ripping the skin off of my body, and it makes me feel like a man. A man that exfoliates. With this in mind, don't try scrubbing your balls with it directly unless you're one of those weird dudes that likes the feeling of sandpaper on his thrill drill. It's probably the strongest smelling soap I've ever used, but that's a good thing - I don't wear cologne usually, so this pretty much has me covered. 9/10, would scrub again. But not my balls.",4,2013-12-13 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

True,Does its job,Soap Saver,"My boyfriend has become obsessed with Sasquatch's Pine Tar soap but we found he was going through it very fast. I purchased the soap saver to try and extend the life of his soap and he has noticed his Pine Tar bars are lasting a bit longer, maybe an extra week or so. 

It is much smaller then the picture leads you to believe, actually about have the size of the square bars of soap themselves, but it still works great!",5,2013-12-16 04:00:00+00:00,70698419

True,"Nice soap, but not my favorite",Spearmint Basil,"I like the feel of the soap and it didn't dry my skin out too bad like some bar soaps, but I was not crazy about the fragrance. To me, the smell was a bit to sweet and not very manly. I expected a more woodsy, Christmas tree smell, but to me it just smelled like spearmint chewing gum. Not really my cup of tea. 



If you like the woodsy, earthy scent and prefer a more manly aroma, I recommend jumping strait to the Pine Tar soap. That is one of my favorite soaps I have ever used. Highly recommend!",4,2014-01-10 04:00:00+00:00,70701388

But I've tried 3 different bars so far, and they don't seem to last very long. I get about 7-10 days use out of them before they crumble apart.

True,Not wowed by this soap.,Spearmint Basil,"For the Christmas season, I bought a few bars of soap from Sasquatch Soap Co. Spearmint Basil Scrub is the first soap I'm trying. 



I have hard water so I'm used to the dryness and 'clean feeling'.



I thought I'd give the soap a generous try before commenting. It does have some moisturizers. It leaves a very light scent if any at all. It's not a long lasting scent. ""Scrub"" is not a characteristic I would have included in the product description.



IMHO this soap is not for me. I was not wowed by this soap",1,2014-02-05 04:00:00+00:00,70701388
True,I like this soap A LOT,Cedar Citrus,"I just started using this soap a week ago. 



I have hard water and I'm used to it.



It has a strong scent and it has serious hang time. Even my bath towels has this scent now. It doesn't have a whole lot of moisturizers. It smells like 65% citrus 35% cedar-ish. The cedar smell is what lasts long.



I would buy this soap again.",5,2014-02-05 04:00:00+00:00,70701577
True,Disappointed,Best Sellers Gift Box,My husband is a HUGE fan of the soap but I was disappointed in the gift box because I was expecting a more rustic box that matches/resembled the soap's style or picture. Instead it was sent in a velvet covered modern-looking cigar box. No big deal but I was disappointed as was he (it was a gift for his birthday). I would recommend the soap but definitely not the gift box set. He's ordered the soap before and loved it....I was just hoping for something equally appealing when I got him the box gift.,3,2014-02-06 04:00:00+00:00,81318210

True,Pine Tar is simply amazing,Pine Tar,"I originally tried this item as a sample from Birchbox Man. I enjoyed the soap so much that I ordered the full size along with two other types. The smell is very rich and strong, but isn't overwhelming after use. You won't walk around all day smelling like a pine tree. I'm a big fan of the exfoliants that are in the soap as well. I like this product a lot and feel like it spices up my normally boring morning ritual.",5,2014-02-07 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Can't get enough!,Pine Tar,"I recently ordered four bars. The Gold Moss, Bay Rum, Pine Tar, and Cedar Citrus.

True,Great soap-wouldn't recommend buying the box gift set,Best Sellers Gift Box,"My husband loves the soap & rightfully so...smells awesome! I was disappointed in the box that came with the gift set. I was led to believe it would either be wooden (like in the picture) or at least rustic looking--like the soap. Instead, it arrived in a black velvet modern-looking cigar box. I was bummed but even more so when I gave it to my husband for valentines day & he said ""oh I love the soap! But dang, I was hoping I'd get the wooden box like in the picture!"" (He'd been talking about it--that's why I purchased it.)

True,Works well but goes fast,Pine Tar,"When I first opened the box I expected to be punched in the face by a pine tree, hoping someone finally got it right, but alas it was the same pine smell I am used to when you buy anything that is scented. Using the soap in the shower; I noticed it lathered well, exfoliated very well, cleaned up my flaky skin, but left a nice black soap scum trail from the soap shelf in the corner despite being out if the shower spray. The soap itself went extremely fast but I assume that is what you get when you don't want something factory made. Overall it was good soap but goes too quickly for my dollar to suds ratio.",3,2014-03-18 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

True,Not worth the $12,Soap Saver,"It's as big as the soap bars. Very light, so light it feels cheap. It smells so much of cedar that it makes your soap smell like cedar which defeats the purpose of buying a soap for its specific scent. Too pricey for such a product. Would not recommend this to anyone.",1,2014-08-20 04:00:00+00:00,70698419
True,High quality soap!,Spearmint Basil,"This soap smells really good. I would have to say the scent is 65% spearmint and 35% basil. I've been using it for the past week and it has left my skin feeling really soft. I also use it on my hair and it lathers really quickly. My hair feels nice and is visibly healthier. The only downside is that the smell isn't strong on the skin, but other than that I'd have to say it is very much worth purchasing.

Definitely leaves you feeling clean and the scent stays with you subtly throughout the day. Speaking of scent, this has warm notes of wood, fresh clay, maybe some honey and other spices...(in my opinion). Other coworkers just say I smell like a man of the woods. Either way, it is an excellent soap. I shower 2x a day from work and exercise and it has lasted for a month so far. Highly recommended and a top contender for best scent. Again, want to try the others but this one needs to run out first.",5,2014-08-22 04:00:00+00:00,70701905

True,The ultimate scrubbing soap.,Pine Tar,"This soap is the best for needing a good scrub down. I like to use it after doing most household activities such as painting, weed-whacking, and gardening. It's great at scrubbing the dirt and grim off. Although it does sort of a dark consistency when washing and rinsing off, I always look and feel clean. It even stripped a tick off my leg as I was washing. It might be the best to have a significant other wash your back with it. I kick like a dog.",5,2014-08-22 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

True,"Great soap, but not very scrubby",Spearmint Basil,"I love the quality of this soap. It cleans well, lathers well and smells great. However, as a scrubbing bar it leaves much to be desired. Perhaps I received a bar from a batch where the scrubbing bits were not as evenly mixed, or there was a flaw in production. 
 
Also, while the soap does smell wonderful, the sharp scent of spearmint lasted only as long as the first shower. The basil scent lasted only a day or two longer. Both can still be smelled if one holds the soap to one's nose, but the bar and the lather really only have a vague, though pleasant, floral scent. 
 
Still, this is great soap. I very much like the way it cleans. I only wish it was as sharp smelling as it was when I opened the shipping package.",3,2014-09-01 04:00:00+00:00,70701388

After learning about the chemicals used in commercial products and their health effects, I decided to turn to a more natural solution. Squatch does a great job of listing the ingredients used, all of which I am comfortable with putting on my body, and comes in environmentally safe packaging. Double win! 
 
The consistency of the soap may seem unusual for first timers transitioning from commercial soap. Natural soap tends to break down easier, especially if you leave your bar of soap next to the bath tub or where it is constantly splashed by your shower, so make sure to keep it on your caddie if you plan on keeping it for long.",4,2014-09-12 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

The soap lathers very nicely, has a great scent and rinses cleanly. Leaving me feeling very refreshed. I shower daily, and even with a soap saver, I do well to get a bar to last 2 weeks. I'm being greedy, I know. Ha. 
I can't say enough good about this product. It's, simply, the best. 
Wish you would offer an after shave/cologne or deodorant. Something that the scent would last longer. This is just a great product. I never write reviews. But, am writing one here, because, I really like this soap. It's the best. Hands down.",5,2014-09-26 04:00:00+00:00,70701905

You say STRONG and that is CORRECT. Too strong for me. I don't want to smell like a roof repair man that has been working with hot pine tar all day long. Patchouli-Sandalwood is more my thing.

True,The Coolio Wooden Soap Dish,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"The wooden soap dish I purchased for my Dr Squatch brand soaps is quite the feat of soap craftsmanship. it's simple design prevents the soap from be washed away by the moisture in my shower while also allowing enough air in to keep the soap from getting all nasty and oogy on the bottom. The fact that the dish is made of cedar wood keeps my shower smelling pleasant and refreshing when it steams up. it also keeps the flies out. And the termites. They buzz right off. The two complaints I have about the dish aren't a huge problem to me, but do keep it from being a five star knockout product. Whether it's the soap or the dish, all of my Dr. Squatch brand soaps (Pine Tar, Bay Rum, and Cedar Citrus) have a tendency to stick to the dish. It takes a bit to unstick the soaps, and occasionally I mar the bar. This next issue may be an issue of newness, but the dish tends to secrete a dark oil when it starts absorbing moisture. The oil hasn't stained anything, but it does discolor the soap and get all over the shower. 
 
Definitely a very good product, and one I would recommend to others. It does have those two issues however.",4,2014-11-19 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Not too shabby at all,Eucalyptus Yogurt,"Overall I really enjoyed this soap; the scent, the exfoliating oatmeal, very good stuff. However, the only thing that kept me from giving this bar five stars is the fact that the scent of the soap is SUPER STRONG when it's not in your body and just chilling in its natural bar state. Not a problem for me, but the wife didn't like it. Apparently it throws off the other scented items she puts around the house. Other than that, top notch soap.",4,2014-11-29 04:00:00+00:00,70700416

True,"So long, Irish Spring!",Pine Tar,"It's expensive, yes. But it's most definitely worth the cost. The scent is the right balance of fragrant & manly, the exfoliation leaves my skin feeling twice as clean as any name brand soap, and it's simple/no frills design looks badass in my shower caddy.

True,Gold Moss Scrub,Gold Moss,"This was my first time using anything other than bodywash or mass-produced soap bars. 
 
Wow. 
 
I was pretty excited that the Gold Moss scrub left essentially no film. That was what drove me away from bar soap to begin with. 
 
Also, the smell. While not overpowering, I find myself walking around daily with the faint aroma of what I could only describe as 'the woods'. I no longer smell like a boring white guy...I smell like a man of the wilderness. 
 
The only issue I had with the process was that the soap actually made it into my city 5 days before it was delivered. I assume this is due to the transfer from UPS to USPS. But once I received the soap, there were no complaints to be had.",5,2014-12-10 04:00:00+00:00,70701905

True,It's soap.,Pine Tar,"I have to say, I'm disappointed by the fact that my Pine Tar soap doesn't smell strongly of anything but bar soap. I'd been expecting something with a much stronger odor.

True,Forest bathing,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"Shinrin-yoku is what the Japanese call a healing walk in the woods, and it translates to ""Forest Bathing"". An appropriate description of the Pine Tar soap!

True,Good smelling sandpaper,Pine Tar,I'm guessing these guys changed up the ingredients for this soap because it now has sand in it which isn't listed on the webpage. This wouldn't be bad except for the fact that the sand is super course and it feels like 50 grit sand paper. I'd like it better with a finer sand if that's what they want in it.,3,2014-12-15 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

True,Great Gift or a Treat for Yourself,Gold Moss,"I bought a few of these soaps as a gift for someone that always jokes about Sasquatch. Since I liked the idea of this outdoorsy golden moss scent so much I ordered one for myself too. The soaps arrived loose in a USPS bag with some corners crushed in.. i hope I don't hear about that on Xmas morning :( And, they are a bit smaller than I would like for the price of it (roughly 3"" x 3"" x 1"") :( However, the scent is very nice and 'medium' in comparison to a typical national store soap brand. I will consider buying more, but hope Dr. Squatch works on their shipment style and overall value.",3,2014-12-16 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
True,SOAPLEASED!,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"Awesome soap! I ordered a few bars of the Pine Tar and Gold Moss Scrub from y'all. It was my first order from your company and I'm soapleased! Order was processed quickly and arrived on time and as ordered.

True,No Makeup On This Pig,Pine Tar,"This soap is exactly what it says. Super exfoliating (as long as you use the bar to skin method) and might be a little too much for the weaker man, but your skin will thank you if you muster up some manhood! The scent is quite strong, but not overbearing and really brings the evergreen forest to your exterior. This soap makes the world less stinky and skin more healthy.

True,Alas Miss Johanson has not yet arrived.,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"Your description for your pine tar soap specifically mentions Scarlett Johanson. Alas she is yet to arrive, which, all things considered is probably a good thing. Right now my wife is enjoying the way your soap makes me smell, and I'm afraid another woman would somehow lessen the pleasure. For her. Great soap, although the 80 grit sandpaper you included in it seems a bit coarse for my old skin. Easily solved with a scrubby thingy. A manly scrubby thingy, made of drill grindings. Definitely will be ordering more soap.",5,2014-12-20 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,The best part of waking up is koala kisses in your cup,Eucalyptus Yogurt,"This soap meets all of my 'squatch-pectations'. The Eucalyptus is very therapeutic and really opens your airways. Breath in that fresh, minty aroma and let the oatmeal and natural oils treat your skin to a vigorous deep cleaning. Remember bar soap lasts longer when you use a washcloth or sponge and always use your soapsaver.",5,2014-12-22 04:00:00+00:00,70700416
True,"Bark sniffin', mitt scrubbin', Pine Tar miracle bar.",Pine Tar,"I love the aroma of this soap and the abrasive sand exfoliate. The only downside (which is that of all pine tar soaps) is the grey residue that is left behind in the form of spots on the shower wall and streaks running down the tub. It's probably not a big deal to most people but I'm a clean freak and also have roommates I have to consider. So this soap isn't a choice of mine for showering. As a hand soap however... LOVE IT! It scrubs away grease, dirt, grime, wood glue, black mud, tracker dye, and anything else you can throw at it. The scent is a bonus that lingers for a long time. I've been using one bar of the Pine Tar for 3 weeks now, washing my hands at least twice a day and it has only lost about a third of its mass.",5,2014-12-22 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

True,Arrrgggghh to the shower with ye olde spicy devil!,Bay Rum,I'm not very familiar with your typical bay rum scent but DR.SQUATCH's Bay Rum bar has a really great aroma.

True,"Aloe, I Love You. Won't you tell me your name?",Cool Fresh Aloe,This bar has a fresh flowery yet mellow scent. It leaves my skin feeling very smooth and is a fine substitute for shampoo.

True,Decent,Pine Tar,"This is a good quality soap, it leathers well and leaves my skin feeling soft. However, the sand and oatmeal make it very rough, it goes away fairly quickly, and while it does smell like pine, the scent is not especially strong and you are not left smelling noticeably like pine after using it.
Bottom line: good soap, but not as strong as advertised.",4,2014-12-22 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Cedar Citrus,Cedar Citrus,"First off, the Cedar Citrus smells amazing! It's a very nice mix of cedar, citrus, and an almost buttery type smell. I bought it right before Christmas so it reminds me of a nice crisp Christmas tree, but more on the side of manly than sparkly snow. 
 
The feel, it leaves my skin nice and hydrated unlike the commercial brand soap I was using before Dr. Squatch. A mild exfoliant won't tear you to shreds but at the same time gets the funk of the day off. 
 
Very refreshing, manly smell and a good clean! 10/10 will be buying more of the Cedar Citrus!",5,2014-12-22 04:00:00+00:00,70701577

True,One of the best soaps I have ever purchased,Pine Tar,"Superb natural fragrance and lather. Great for exfoliation or scrubbing dirty beards! Absolutely a favorite. I've purchasing a variety of natural soaps and this is one of the stand outs. What I love is that it wakes you up, a great soap for a morning shower or to get off late-night grim.

True,The Real Deal,Cedar Citrus,"How often do you buy a men's soap or bodywash with a name like ""Cedar Citrus""--and get something that smells synthetic (and overly strong), or nothing like the name suggests, or overly ""manly""--like someone dunked a navel orange in PineSol and Axe? Not this soap. It's all natural--you can smell only the natural ingredients (literally cedar and citrus oil) and that's it for aroma. Smells great, great lather. And the scent lasts almost all day. This is is the best smelling pine/citrus product I've ever used and (as usual with Doctor Squatch) is a top notch soap.",5,2014-12-23 04:00:00+00:00,70701577

True,smells awesome but expensive,Cedar Citrus,"My only complaint is that you advertise your soaps as designed to last for a month, they definitely do not last that long i used the entire bar in 2 weeks and that was only showering once per day. 
 
I feel like you need to get more soap for the price or it should be cheaper for what you get. 
 
Aside from that you have a great product but I cant justify the price for how long it lasts",3,2014-12-25 04:00:00+00:00,70701577

True,"So far, so good",Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"the bar of pine tar soap lasted just over a week and kept my skin moist in the most dry conditions.

True,Good soap...for men,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I got 4 different scents, mainly because my wife had mentioned all the chemicals in store bought soaps. I thought she'd love these, but she says they all smell too manly (even goat's milk). Just one woman's opinion I guess, but I love the soaps. I'd agree they err on the manly side, but excellent for the guys (and she likes the smell on me).",4,2014-12-26 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Aroma Therapy in a bar,Cedar Citrus,"Medium-strong and pleasing scent, especially in an enclosed shower. Not overpowering, just right. It does a fine job of it's primary function, cleaning your body. The skin is not dried out after using the soap. My favorite is still Gold Moss Scrub, but as a secondary choice to break up the monotony Cedar Citrus is a great choice.",5,2014-12-27 04:00:00+00:00,70701577

True,The Soap is great!,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"Long ago, I was introduced to a scent that was, very hard to find. Recently I purchased the gold moss scrub and the Doctor nailed the scent.

True,Beyond expectations,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,I bought the multi-soap box as a Christmas gift for BF and was delighted at what showed up. The soaps were neatly packaged in an adorable (or handsome since its men's soaps?) wooden box. The delicious smelling soaps were also emanating a wonderful scent even through the mailing package. BF loved it and declared he's even keeping the box. Who knew soap could be such a good gift? Or I guess as long as it's coming from Sasquatch.,5,2014-12-30 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,Great Soap,Dr. Squatch Soapscription,Received a gift subscription and I have really enjoyed it. My skin feels better then with any store bought bars I have ever purchased.

True,Amazing,Crushed Pine,"This was a Christmas gift for my husband. He had bought the hemlock trail soap previous, and loved the scent. I thought the cologne would be the perfect gift. He loved it!! But the best thing of all was my customer service experience. I was contacted via e-mail telling me that my arrival for the cologne was supposed to be on Christmas Eve... but they wanted to know if I wanted FREE upgraded shipping, bc their office was concerned that it wouldn't get here in time... I excepted the upgraded shipping,very grateful.... Then I was contacted one more time, to let me know... That it was my lucky day! They sent me 2 colognes for the price of one!! That was an awesome bonus gift! I will definitely be ordering from Dr. Squatch in the future. Thank Guys!! Much appreciated!!

True,Smooth citrus with a bit of pine,Cedar Citrus,"I've had three cedar citrus bars from two separate orders. The first bar had a lot more of a piney cedar smell, similar to the pine tar soap, with a bit of orange aroma. The second order I received had a slightly different smell to them. There was more of a citrus smell with just barely a hint of cedar. These bars from the second order also had a more mellow scent to them, even when I lathered them up they were less aromatic than the first batch. Still left my skin feeling very clean without feeling dry.",5,2014-12-30 04:00:00+00:00,70701577

True,Pine Tar is awesome,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I ordered several soaps from Dr. Squatch in an effort to test them all and decide which one to re-order or to just scrap the entire idea of ""Hand-Made Men's Soap"" the first one I tried was Pine Tar, which looks quite similar to a cube of heavy tar with flecks of sawdust peppered throughout. At first it seemed a little rough, rubbing the bar on my bare skin felt like dragging heavenly 100-grit sandpaper all over my body. Naturally I wasn't in the shower alone, and my girlfriend decided to try out Pine Tar as well, she winced ""ouch! It hurts!"" When I read that this soap was ""exfoliating"" I felt that it was a little foo-foo, so let me re-phrase that claim. This soap (in one session) removed the accumulated blood, sweat, automotive grease, and grime from my latest differential re-build, bringing my skin down to its natural form. It was invigorating. Also, the smell. After one shower my one bedroom apartment took on the glorious smell of a carpentry shop. I will be ordering Pine Tar again. I still have five more soaps to try out, but I'm not sure anything can compare.",5,2014-12-30 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,Christmas Gift,Best Sellers Gift Box,"I purchased the Gift Box for my brother as a Christmas Gift. He really loves the soap! I will probably be ordering some more in the future.

True,I Love How My Guy Smells,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"My boyfriend had been gifted the Pine Tar soap a few months back and we were both hooked after one whiff. Unfortunately, I was forbidden to use his precious soap, with him even going as far as to hide it from me come shower-time. This holiday season, I purchased nearly the entire line AND the gift set for him. The set was bespoke; four hand-selected bars carefully arranged with the scents I had chosen in a pretty dapper cigar box. Each fragrance is distinct, balanced and clean- I am hard-pressed to find even one I dislike in the slightest. Lately, he has been favoring Spearmint Basil, which does... things to my insides ;) He has managed to hide even these nine bars from me, so awkwardly sniffing him will have to suffice for the time being.",5,2015-01-01 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Fab!,Pine Tar,"This is one of the best soaps I've ever tried. The smell is strong in a good way, it surrounds you but doesn't suffocate you.

I, a dainty lady, used the moss soap and was pleasantly surprised at how clean and soft I felt.",5,2015-01-02 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,"Not quite Gold Moss, but still great.",Beechwood Bourbon,"Don't let the label of ""cologne"" fool you, this is something totally different than what you are used to. Where boutique colognes tend to be complex and wildly unique, Driftwood is very blunt and somehow gently in-your-face. This is a scent for a simple sort of man who wants his admirers to feel like they are relaxing in a classic American log cabin instead of in a boardroom full of European suits. 
 
The bottle is small, but the scent in the oil is so strong that you don't need but a drop to rub between wrists and on neck to be surrounded in a cloud of warm, citrusy wilderness with a hint of spice. I would describe the scent as sandalwood and spicey grapefruit, with the strong presence of the sandalwood giving way to the grapefruit as time goes on. The strength of the scent seems to wane after 4 or so hours, but it doesn't completely go away for much longer. Basically par for the course with other colognes, though I'm applying a fraction of what I would have to apply with my old Armani to get this presence of scent. 
 
I like that it's all natural oils. I like that I don't smell like a frat boy or a french businessman. Use at your own risk, you may find older women start to call you ""daddy"" once this is applied.",5,2015-01-02 04:00:00+00:00,70704176

True,A Most Godly Smell,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"Definitely must say the smell in amazing! I literally could smell it through the shipment packaging! Though must say the way you ship your products is most unsatifatory! I was sent three bars of soap in a flat rate bubble envelope, not box. The post office charged me to simply get this package, I should not have to pay extra for a package I already paid shipping for! A small flat rate box is basically five dollars and I paid six dollars. I know you want to make a good profit because lets face it, you do have a really good product but your shipping needs upgrades.

True,"I smell so manly - - it's been validated by strangers, true strangers",Gold Moss,"I am a Gold Moss Scrub man. It's clear that not only does my shower smell nice, fresh and very manly, I am too smell manly. Very manly. Everyone is now clearly confused by my fresh and manly smell. I've been told by the cadre of sniffers around me that I am reminiscent of the two manly actors Denzel Washington and Steve McQueen. And I don't disagree. 
 
This is great soap, leaves you feeling clean, and for those of us that hate that itchy winter, dried out skin-experience, it doesn't make your skin ashy. 
 
I'm going to the break room to fill up my water bottle here at work. It's really just a rouse to receive compliments on just how great I smell and how clean I look on my way there. I think I'll take the long route.",5,2015-01-08 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
True,soap saver... meh,Soap Saver,"The first soap saver I got was cracked. I contacted the company and they immediately shipped a new one. No muss, no fuss, excellent customer service. The soap saver itself is mediocre at best. The soap sticks something fierce and bits pull off when trying to pry the soap from the saver. When the soap gets down to around a 1/4 inch it falls apart while trying to separate it from the wooden saver. I like the idea, but execution definitely leaves something to be desired.

So to recap: smells great, makes your skin hydrated and healthy, and lasts forever.

Seriously, let's get to the soap review. I purchased the Bay Rum because that has always been my favorite scent in any soap. Dr. Squatch has a great soap here. I can't believe how clean I feel, and my skin is so soft, like lose my man card soft. It's such a great way to start my day. Normally I roll around and put off getting out of bed until the last second, but recently I have been up early because my morning shower is refreshing and get's me ready for the day. Mama Squatch says I smell good too, which is great. Little squatches keep sneaking my soap out of the shower, however they are not smart squatches because their smooth skin and great smell tips them off every time. I think I'm either going with the sampler pack next or the monthly delivery, this stuff is perfect.",5,2015-01-22 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,"Great exfoliant, but smell doesn't last",Pine Tar,"I never considered myself to have sensitive skin, but at times it felt like I was washing with sandpaper in my shower.

True,Hardcore clean,Pine Tar,"Not for the faint of heart, Pine Tar is eye-opening and refreshing. Be prepared if you use the bar directly on your skin, as its rite of passage like walking on broken light bulbs or swallowing fire -- the sand in the bar is closer to gravel. Say goodbye to dead skin, and maybe a layer or two of the good stuff. But there's something very rewarding about using Pine Tar that starts my day off right. Like, if I can get through that, I can tackle anything this day can throw at me. Highly recommend.",5,2015-01-29 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

True,"Love the Smells, but leaves my skin dry",Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I am currently using the Bay Rum and my skin has never felt so dry. I love the scents, so I will continue to use them, if only every couple of days or only on special occasions. This has made me demote my soapscription to one every month.

True,Manly Heaven,Pine Tar,"i absolutely love this soap. I got Bay Rum, Pine Tar and Gold Moss. I've been using the Pine Tar but haven't had a chance to try the others.

Old Dr. Squatch will be my soap from here on out.",4,2015-02-02 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,I need an excuse to shower more often,Pine Tar,"This soap is something else. It smell incredible and it makes you and your bathroom smell incredible.

When you use this soap, you can feel it cutting into the dirt, sweat and dead skin, allowing you to shed your molt and step out of the shower feeling clean, fresh and new.",5,2015-02-02 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Cool product -- pack it better!,Soap Saver,"The soap saver is a cool product. It does a great job keeping that scummy leftover layer off of the surfaces in the shower. 
 
ONE THING: put an extra later of bubble wrap around it or start packaging it in a padded box if it own!! It was snapped in two when it got to me. It was easy enough to glue together, but immediately after pulling it out of the package I knew why it wasn't still in one piece. It's extremely delicate. Take precautions. 
 
Overall a good product. Nice fresh smell and helps keep things clean, but it is fragile and should be packed as such.",3,2015-02-02 04:00:00+00:00,70698419

True,Good Soap but fleeting,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I really enjoyed using this soap, I had the Gold Moss, and Pine. 
I found the scents pleasant but not over powering. My only two complaints is the short life of the tiny bars and the cost of shipping. If they offered free shipping, I would be inclined to become a regular customer, I already mail order my razors.",4,2015-02-06 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Soaps,Best Sellers Gift Box,I like the soaps a lot. Love the package too. I do think for $6.00 a bar I am struggling to see the value in them but I do like them. I have used 2 bars so far and enjoy the scents and the exfoliating feel I get from them. They last about 10 showers but when it comes down to it not something I would buy on regular basis but would like to have on occasion. As much as I enjoy them I do not see spending $25.00 plus a month on soaps. I think you have a good product but I just don't have the budget to buy regularly.

True,Web Site and Customer Service,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"Based up just the website and the customer service it self i would Have to give you 4 star review. First i have not received my order yet so i cannot review the product itself. Secondly, The reason for only 4 stars and not 5 is because when one of the products I ordered was on back order, I did not receive any notification that delivery would be behind schedule. It was left up to me to contact you to figure out what was going on with my order. In my own opinion, this should not be something a customer should worry about, they should be informed as early as possible that something has not gone as planned and the product will be shipped at a later time. Besides that the website is very easy to use as well as good descriptions of products to allow you to choose what may suit you best. Once I was in contact with customer support, they were very friendly and responded to me in a reasonable time frame and let me know exactly what was going on, while giving me options to help with getting my product here as quickly as possible.",4,2015-02-17 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Smell like a man.,Crushed Pine,i went into a drug store the other day and decided to check out the colognes. The lady who helped me had me sample all the ones that were her favorites and I noticed a trend. They were all feminine smelling. i asked her if maybe she was mistaken and these were actually the womens perfumes but she insisted that they were for men. I ended up having to purchase a bottle of whiskey and pouring it on myself to cover up that feminine odor. There were none of these problems with Dr. Squatches Hemlock Trail.

Doesn't bother me, in fact it's kinda cool if color matters for a soap. Unfortunately the smell seems to disappear after I dry off and leave the bathroom. Why only 2 stars? I've used it for a week and it's almost gone. But the exfoliating ""oatmeal"" isn't like any oatmeal I've ever seen. Pretty sure it's actually gravel, and it's way too rough - it's way rougher than any Lava or other gritty soap that I use in the garage. Guess I'm not man enough.

On a side note I had a touch of chlorine rash the other day. Scrubbed it away with the Pine Tar soap. It hurt like hell but the rash was gone in the morning. If none of that has convinced you perhaps telling you that wave upon wave of girls have been flocking to me since I started using this soap.

True,"5 star scent, 3 star longevity",Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"Ordered one bar of pine tar and one bay rum. Plenty of other reviews have gone on at length about the intensity of the pine tar. The pine scent is crazy-potent and the exfoliants are like 20 grit sand paper and crushed glass. Great if you need to take off a year of grime and dead skin. Otherwise? It might be more than you need. This might not sound like a glowing review, but the fact is? Coarseness aside? I like the bar. I was just a bit surprised to see how rapidly it diminished. somewhere around 8 - 10 showers in, it was a thin shadow of its former self. Coming from a different brand of hand-cut soap sold in 3.5 oz cubes that survived a month+ in my shower? I guess I expected more from the larger Dr. Squatch bar. Seems like the oatmeal and sand combine to make the bar less dense, so it just goes a lot faster. As for the Bay Rum? I just switched over to it. Love this scent (as does my wife - much more so than the Pine Tar). In fact, I like it enough so sign up for a subscription.

What I mean is, after I'm done using the Squatch soap (loving it, highly recommend the soap) I place it in the saver. When I come back the next day, I have to pry it off the saver because it's stuck to it so much. I have chunks all over the saver from where I ripped the soap off.

True,Its no joke!!!,Pine Tar,"This is the 1st Dr Squatch soap I have tried. As others have said the exfoliants mean business!! Very coarse ( I don't use the bar directly on my face) kind of wish was it was a bit more fine and spread out more evenly.

After two months of very infrequent bathing, dirt accumulation under the finger nails, and a stench so raunchy my dog wouldn't come near me, your product definitely did the trick. I'm definitely going to be a repeat customer and eagerly await what new products you guys will come up with. Keep Killin it.

True,It's the soap I deserve,Pine Tar,"I've been on the lookout for a piney soap for a long time now, and while I could theoretically take the ole' floor approach and bathe in Pine-Sol, I've heard industrial cleaning products are generally unhealthy for the skin. In comes Dr. Squatch. 
 
It's exactly what I was hoping for. It's a crisp pine smell that's not overbearing, and seems to exfoliate the skin. Though I admit that as a man using pine scented soap, I don't really and shouldn't know exactly what that means, but I definitely feel the bar grinding the grime off me with a deep, dark lather. 
 
Even the customer service is great. USPS claimed to not be able to deliver my package, and within a day, Dr. Squatch already had another package in the mail. USPS eventually delivered my original package, but Dr. Squatch refused to accept a return. I'll be smelling good for a while, thanks!",5,2015-03-11 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

True,Good Stuff,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"Ordered the Gold Moss and Pine Tar soaps and both smelled great and got the job done. Got a sampler of the cologne too. There is not much difference in smell between the two, so don't spend a lot of time trying to decide which flavor to buy. Both smelled like trees. I would say they are more suitable as beard oil, since the smell does not linger very long on the skin.

True,Gold Moss Review,Gold Moss,"I really want to like this soap more than I do. The smell is great, but almost non-existent after about half an hour. I also love the marketing strategy and the all-natural, manly, wilderness vibe of the brand. The soap itself, however, seems to be withering away rather quickly and I haven't quite had it a week (and no, I don't bathe extremely frequently). I just wish the soap, and the smell, lasted as long as other similar products I've used. Maybe it's just the Gold Moss Scrub, but I figured the ""Most Popular Scent"" was a good first bet.

What I think about the scents are completely opinionated, but they do all smell amazing. Golden Moss is probably my favorite. Being a guy that never really cared about what soap I use, this really opened my eyes.

The smell is subtle at first, but later seems stronger after the smell from the shower emanates into the rest of my apartment. I enjoy the exfoliating elements, which make it feel like I'm getting extra clean and scrubbed down. I think it will last at least another week, but I anticipate it will not last much more than two weeks, as the bar is fairly small. I'm strongly considering signing up for one of the subscription plans. This is a product that I just feel so good about because it is all-natural and has a good scent.

Until then I'll stick to drinking whiskey and secretly smelling myself. It has little to no exfoliation. Rated the same as the Greek yogurt but lacking any real grit to it. Just smooth all around. It's in my subscription list for sure.,5,2015-04-09 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
True,Perfect in every way (except one),Deep Sea Goats Milk,"I love love love this soap. I get compliments on the scent and I like that it is subtle, but lasting. My favorite is the Gold Moss Scrub.

True,Bay rum and pine tar,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,I just want to start off simple and say I love the bay rum scent. It smells great and has a very smooth lather. Now the pine tar doesn't have too much of a pine scent as others I've tried so it's not the best and it is a little coarse on the skin so you can't apply it too harshly if anything I use it more on my beard than my body.,4,2015-04-09 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,Pine tar soap,Pine Tar,"My 1st purchase of pine tar soap had sand in it, but my 2nd purchase did not. I like both and would like the option to buy either one.

True,"good quality soap, bad ergonomics",Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"A square is not a good shape for a bar of soap. It's awkward to hold. I wish they would make their soap in a more traditional rectangular shape which is much easier to hold on to.

Otherwise the soap is high quality, smells great and is gentle on the skin. I love the colognes!",4,2015-04-11 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,She gets turned on,Best Sellers Gift Box,"I've been using the soaps for a while and I bought the gift box for my brother to try out. When I gave them to him the first thing he said was he loved the (cigar) box that it came in and that he would've been happy with just the box. I told him to open the box. When he did he looked at me and asked me why I bought him soap. I said, ""Because now you can smell like a man and not some cheap French wh*re."" His wife laughed. Then he started using them. His favorite is the Gold Moss. He's thanked me for them, but his wife thanks me every few days and tells me she loves it when he uses any of the soaps because it turns her on.

True,You are missing out,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"This soap is great. I started out just planning on using it for my beard because I was tired of using something with a lot of harsh chemicals that stripped everything out. After one beard wash, I decided this was going to be my full time full body soap. It leaves you feeling clean without any residue. The smell is great. Not overpowering and not to sweet. It smells like man soap should smell. I'm hooked.

True,It's a breath of fresh air,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"im a soap whore. And I'm not even referring to the fancy stuff. If you've ever known someone to use a particular brand of soap because of sentimental value please tell them they are not alone. I'm a Zest guy till the end of time but this stuff that Dr. Squatch is putting out just pretty much gave me closure on the soap sentiment. If I want to remember my grand parents I'll hang a picture on the wall. I'll never buy another bar of zest again. Now my soap budget has freakin quadrupled, I've had to take a second job. But I lucked out and score a job at a veterinarian's office spaying cats. I've made tons of extra money on commissions for referrals.

True,Good product; moderate value at $15,Soap Saver,Certainly an attractive storage vessel for my soap AND it absolutely works as described. I dinged the rating because I just can't justify the price for a small strategically cut piece of wood.

I once viewed showering as a mandatory activity that was just routine and had to be done, but now with this, I see showering as a privilage and truly look forward to it. In addition, is acts like sort of an air freshener in my bathroom and makes the whole place smell just beyond great.

Women can't resist me, the villagers have quit trying to burn me at the stake, and I am now the mayor of Awesomeville.

True,The Best bar of soap I have ever used !,Pine Tar,"The Pine Tar soap works perfectly. It cleans and exfoliates and leaves a very clean and natural scent. I have tried so many soaps and now I can finally say that my search is over. My wife is even thrilled because I stay smelling clean all day. Happy wife, Happy Life ! Thank you Dr. Squatch",5,2015-05-02 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Wow I smell good,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,This is really good cologne and the price is just right compared to some other products I have purchased in the past. Check it out for yourself.,5,2015-05-02 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,Best soap ever,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,i found Dr. Squatch on Facebook on a whim. I checked out the website and was intrigued by the woodsy scents of soaps after years of only using body wash. I ordered the pine tar bar and I'll never go back. Their soap is amazing. It smells wonderful and makes my skin feel incredible. I've recommended this product to all my friends.,5,2015-05-03 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Great Soap - could be larger,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I am more than pleased with the Pine Tar soap - the scent quite strong, but not unpleasant, but it mellows fairly quickly. If I had a quibble, it's that the bars are quite small, and a single bar will be worn away in about ten days. 
 
I absolutely recommend this soap if you're looking to not smell like a chemical factory.",4,2015-05-03 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Nothing special,Pine Tar,"If you want to smell like your floors, this is the soap for you. The scent is more like pine-sol than a woodsy pine smell - I was hoping for something more like your typical pine candle scent. The exfoliants are very sharp and make it impossible to use directly on your skin. The soap itself however is perfectly fine and doesn't leave my skin overly dry or oily. I'll be trying one of the other scents without an exfoliant.",3,2015-05-04 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Some Damn Good Soap,Best Sellers Gift Box,"I found it weird to be excited for...well soap. But truthfully I love getting/trying new things. My old soap used to dry my skin pretty bad, and although it was bearable I wanted something different. I loved the advertisement for Dr. Squatch soaps, the idea was great and it was just what I was looking for. They all smell great! If I had only one gripe, its that the bars don't seem to last very long. I'd recommend this to any dude willing to try a natural soap and wanting to smell awesome.",4,2015-05-04 04:00:00+00:00,81318210
True,Good,Cool Fresh Aloe,I would have given this one a 5 star but it seems to melt much faster than the Pine Tar soap. I do like the scent. It is mild and much less overwhelming than others but I would like it to last at least another week. I was lucky to get 2 weeks use before it all melted away.,4,2015-05-04 04:00:00+00:00,70699856
True,Loving Dr Squatch,Best Sellers Gift Box,Love the packaging. Is a gift that I have not given yet so can not say how great they think it is but it does look and smell great!,5,2015-05-05 04:00:00+00:00,81318210

True,Love it,Eucalyptus Yogurt,"I have seen a lot of reviews saying that people only get 3 or 4 washes out of a bar...well, people...it makes enough of a severe lather that you don't need to make contact with EVERY inch of your body with the bar every time. I'm a head-shaver, so I only use the bar on my head, chest, and arms...with PLENTY of clean lather to cover the rest of me left over. Anyway, on to the smell...damn its strong, and REALLY helps you wake up in the morning, and relax at night. Sure you don't smell it ALL day, like people complain about...but how long do you smell like that Irish Spring bar you use after a shower?",5,2015-05-05 04:00:00+00:00,70700416

True,excellent quality...,Soap Saver,"excellent quality. Does what it's supposed to. However, you'd sell many more if you could get the price down say $5. $15 for a soap saver is a little pricey. Or throw one in for free if we buy three bars of soap, etc.",3,2015-05-05 04:00:00+00:00,70698419
True,"Good, but not as fragrant as the others",Gold Moss,"I love Squatch soaps. They're frackin' amazing. BUT, this one...I'd pass on when I make my next order. It's just not fragrant as the others. It's that simple.

True,Oasis Wonderland,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,I bought the Bay Rum as my first bar and look forward to showering every day. Who doesn't feel good about themselves in the morning when you enter an oasis wonderland. When I don't want to wake up in the morning I just remember that when I get out of bed my next move is going to take me to smelling like a man who knows how to fight but chooses not to and instead uses the power of logic and nature to will you into peace and prosperity. That is a man I would like to be and this soap helps me takes steps in that direction everyday. Plus it gets you clean.,5,2015-05-06 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Great product.,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I've bought more expensive soap, and it wasn't quite worth it. Dr. Squatch bars are a different story. Great scents followed by a squeeky-clean feeling have won me over.

True,Fresh Ideas,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"Bought the fresh gift set for my best friend and had it shipped to another state. He LOVED the manliness of it all.

True,"Soap (not the series, but I like that too.)",Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"Bay Rum. Bestest soap ever. Nice scent, lather, and performance. I have other squares to navigate, I don't think those will disappoint. I'm glad I made the switch to Dr Squatch.",5,2015-05-08 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,Pine Tar & Gold Moss,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"The descriptions of these soaps are definitely accurate. Pine Tar is a strong woodsy scent. As far as the oatmeal in the bar goes, it's a huge plus. I have some skin problems and the benefits of this soap were almost immediate. When the bar began to run out I bought another and also picked up the Gold Moss to try out. This bar and it's scent is totally different, but equally great. There's really nothing quite like it, whereas the Pine Tar smells like a fresh cut tree. 

What I really enjoy about both of these bars and any soap from Dr. Squatch is the lack of chemicals. My skin is a lot less itchy and irritated. I've also been able to replace my shampoo with this soap. It definitely does the job without making my hair practically fall out. In just a month it grew back about 3x more than before. I've had this stuff in my eyes too and you can't even feel it. 

Overall the smell is good and long-lasting, the things it does for you skin and hair is incredible, and at $6 it's totally worth it. Chances are if your girlfriend is like mine she'll love it too, and with the leftover sliver of Pine Tar I had left the dog got a good bath with it. 

As a guy living in the Pacific Northwest that spends most of his time in the woods and sand dunes and racing ATV's, I'd say this soap lives up to what it claims and exceeds expectations. There's no reason not to take good care of yourself and smell awesome, and this soap will get you there.",5,2015-05-08 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,Wonderful,Cologne Samples,"These samples were exactly what I was looking for. I didn't know how they smelled and didn't want to commit to a full bottle until I tried them. 
 
They both have a very nice smell and I'll be ordering one soon. Thanks for the product!",5,2015-05-08 04:00:00+00:00,70705703
True,Earthy,Beechwood Bourbon,This is a cologne for guys who don €:tm:t wear cologne. It €:tm:s subtle in the way a walk through a forest leaves a hint of nature and fresh air on your clothes. More importantly my lady likes it. Thumbs up.,5,2015-05-08 04:00:00+00:00,70704176
False,Wife doesn't like it. Girlfriend does!,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,When I received the Driftwood Oil I put a little on and came home. The wife took one long smell and said for me to never wear it again. That night I visited my girlfriend and put just a small amount on again and she LOVED IT! Now what? Will the wife know I'm seeing someone else if I come home with it on. What a dilemma. Any suggestions?,3,2015-05-08 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,Pine Tar & Gold Moss Scrub,Pine Tar,Both smell great but the Pine Tar is more abrasive than it needs to be. I like that its meant to exfoliate but sometimes it is extremely uncomfortable due to the sand.,3,2015-05-08 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Manliest Damn Soap Around,Pine Tar,"The Pine Tar soap is by the far the finest bar soaps I've ever scrubbed my body with. The sand serves as a scratchy exfoliant which can be a little rough, but damnit - if it's good enough for a sasquatch, it's good enough for me. I've been using it daily for about a week and about 1/3 gone which means I will easily burn through this soap in 3 weeks on average. 
 
Still - smells great and is super high quality. Can't wait to try more!",5,2015-05-09 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

True,"Good soap, just not enough of it.",Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I ordered the pine tar soap, which smells as great as it sounds. Loved the abrasiveness of the soap which made me feel I was getting a really deep clean. The only down side of the soap is that there isn't enough of it. The bar lasted less than two weeks. 
I would definitely purchase a much hardier ""squatch sized"" bar if it were offered.",3,2015-05-10 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,Smells like Valhalla!,Crushed Pine,"When I opened the box, it was like being among warriors, and drinking from the cup of VICTORY! The soap stripped off grime, oil, dirt, and doubt.

True,Spearmint Basil Scrub,Spearmint Basil,"The soap is smaller than I thought it would be, but that doesn't change the fact it's an awesome soap. The smell isn't as strong or as minty as I thought it would be though. It still feels great on my skin!",4,2015-05-10 04:00:00+00:00,70701388

True,Not my favorite,Pine Tar,"the smell is ok, but between that and the scratchy things in it, doesn't make for an enjoyable shower experience. Unless you're in true need of some exfoliation, I would suggest getting something else.",3,2015-05-11 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,"So good, so far.",Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"Reformed shower gel user trying the bar soap thing for the first time since the late 90's. Dr. Squatch seems to have his s**t together. I've only been using the bar for a week and I'm already noticing that my skin has not dried out like it did with the shower gel.

True,Solid soap. Okay Scent. Extremely abrasive.,Pine Tar,"Perfect soap if you want to smell like your floors. This has more of a Pine-Sol scent than the woodsy evergreen scent I was hoping for. The exfoliants are VERY coarse, sharp, and as a result, extremely abrasive. I couldn't use this soap directly on my skin without feeling like I was going through a cheese grater. As for the soap material itself, it cleans well and doesn't leave my skin feeling overly dry. Works great. My next bar simply won't contain any exfoliants.",2,2015-05-15 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,"Nice scent, but wheres the exfoliant ??",Gold Moss,"I was looking forward to try this scent, my 4th one from Dr Squatch, because of the reviews.
While I do enjoy the scent of the Gold Moss the exfoliant is non existent!! 
I have tried the Pine Tar with the ""rip your face off"" exfoliant as well as the Eucalyptus Greek Yogurt with a light amount of exfoliants, which so far has been my preference.

Being a fan of BIGFOOT since I was a child, I made an ""impulse buy"" of yor Dr. Squatch soap... Thinking it would be more of a conversation item. Boy, was I wrong.

I really like the smell of the soap but, I don't think ill be using this one again just for the simple reason that it is to exfoliating for my taste.

True,Awesome Soap!,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I have only tried Gold Moss Scrub so far, but I love it! It has a slightly sweet smell to it, but not flowery.

True,Cool Fresh Aloe,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"awesome soap! came across the brand via an ad on Facebook and couldn't be happier that I actually clicked it.

True,Soap Review 1st Test,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"Enjoyed the smell and the way it lathers up. Followed the advice to make soap last longer ,put on soap dish,use face towel,but It kept on shrinking fast,then found out my son was using it too.

True,Bay Rum,Spearmint Basil,"Before and after a long day, I like to scrub down with a bar of Bay Rum. I like to think it's how my forefathers smelled while fighting the British, or the Army of the South. I imagine Granddad Buzzard smelling like rum and spices after working in his distillery all day. Either way, I feel refreshed, smell like a man, and my mrs. enjoys the spice notes. I highly recommend Bay Rum!",5,2015-05-30 04:00:00+00:00,70701388
True,Excellent!,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,I went to see my girlfriend a few days ago and after a 4 hour session in bed I went to take a shower. There it was staring at me-- A black cube of Dr. Squash Pine Tar soap so I lathered up and the smell was like being in the forest!

False,Where is it????,Pine Tar,"I purchased Pine Tar 14 days ago. The confirmation email stated I would get an email with shipping info. I never got that email, and I never got my soap.

True,Not what I expected,Cool Fresh Aloe,"The smell is ok. Out of the box it is a bit strong; Almost like Pinesol. Once applied it dulls considerably, leaving nice notes to tickle your nose. The main selling point to this product for me was ""Think of it as an Irish Spring that doesn't dry out"". Unfortunately I have found it not to be the case; Not for me anyway. It actually dries my beard out a lot. Exactly the way Irish Spring dries out my skin as a matter of fact. I have used it twice and have had to condition my beard with regular hair conditioner both times. Shipping time was fairly slow. Did receive order number after my purchase but never recieved a notice of shipment as they said they would. Tried to contact them about it but was left hanging. Waste of nine dollars. Would not do business with them again.",2,2015-06-01 04:00:00+00:00,70699856
True,Smells like the forest,Pine Tar,"This right here is how a man should smell. The bits of pine or bark or whatever is a great exfoliant and it smells freaking amazing.

True,Soap and Cologne!,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I've been using the soaps for several months now and have tried about half. The quality of the soap is fantastic. They have great smells that wake me up in the morning! They don't leave a standard grocery store soap residue on the shower door or my skin! I wouldn't say that I've tried a soap that I dislike just some that I prefer over others. I tried the cologne sampler pack and was hooked. They are a great weekend scent that is not over powering and is reminiscent of the out doors. The descriptions on the website pretty accurately describe what you are getting. If you are on the fence try the sampler, more than worth it. All in all I'm thoroughly enjoying my soapscription and cologne. High quality products! Truly glad I found Dr. Squatch.",5,2015-06-05 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,A True Man's Soap,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"Since I can remember, I'm a guy who has used gel body wash. I got a sample of the golden moss scrub, and since then, I've been hooked. My favorite scent by far is the pine tar. It's like reaching into the heart of the oldest pine in the forest, pulling pulp from the middle, and scrubbing yourself anew. As long as this soap is available, I will be a loyal customer.",5,2015-06-05 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,"Good Soap, Nice Cologne - Shipping leaves some to be desired.",Cologne Samples,"I recently purchased the Pine Tar Soap, and Cologne Samples. The soap is great! Has an awesome scent, gritty exfoliating sand, and leaves you feeling clean. I'm not a fan of the Driftwood cologne, smells like an old smoker to me. The Hemlock Trail on the other hand, is divine. It's exactly like walking through a pine forest - it's great. Lastly, shipping is $6 no matter what you buy - which I'm not sure I understand, why not just make the bars $7.25 and offer free shipping? I know there are better ways to ship than UPS. At any rate, it's pretty good, I think I'll be buying more Pine Tar soap, but I'll order a lot at a time to avoid spending crazy amounts on shipping.",4,2015-06-09 04:00:00+00:00,70705703

True,"Great soap, but grandma scent",Deep Sea Goats Milk,"After using a bar of cedar citrus as a beard soap, I recently purchased all the other scents (except Bay Rum) so I could experience all the Dr. Squatch offerings (I will likely review all the scents). I have to say that the soaps are great. I use it primarily on my beard and occasionally on my body. I never feel dried out or covered in a film. I wash my beard at least once a day, and Dr. Squatch soaps help keep it from feeling like hay. The base soap of both scents I have used has been great; I would give the soap five stars. I cannot say the same about the scents.

I would not say Deep Sea Goat's Milk is an earthy men's fragrance. It is very floral. What I pick up most is something along the lines of lavender. This is not to say that men cannot enjoy floral scents; it is 2015, and everyone knows anyone can enjoy whatever they want.

While the description of the scent here says, ""Earthy and Creamy"", I only get a flowery aroma. It is similar to my grandmother's potpourri or a free perfume sample you might get in a Kohl's catalog. Not great and not what I was expecting.

Summary: Soap = five stars; Scent = -1",2,2015-06-10 04:00:00+00:00,70699496
True,"Great soap, good scent",Cedar Citrus,"This was the first Dr. Squatch soap I got. I use it primarily on my beard and occasionally on my body. I have to say I was very pleased. The soap lasted a reasonable amount of time (using it mostly on my beard). I never felt dried out or covered in a film. I wash my beard at least once a day, and I think this soap doesn't leave my facial hair feeling like dried leaves. I recently ordered most of the other scents to try them out. I just started the first of those (Deep Sea Goat's Milk...not a great scent as my review suggests), and the soap quality is just as good.

Cedar citrus is an interesting scent and one that I enjoy. It has a muted and well-rounded orange smell, but the base aroma is that of sweet, damp wood. My apologies if damp wood makes you think mildew. I have used other citrus soaps on the past. While those make you smell like you got a Gatorade shower after winning the Super Bowl or like you had a soaking in a tub if Minute Made concentrate, Cedar citrus has nice complexity and maturity that I enjoy.",5,2015-06-10 04:00:00+00:00,70701577

True,Amazing soap!,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I waited 2 weeks before writing this review to make sure it wasn't just a first day type review. 

I opted for the 2 soap / month subscription and delivery was very quick. I was in contact with customer support to add the cologne testers too and the service was excellent. 

The soaps are great quality and a perfect size. I ordered 6 different flavours (if you can call it that) and they are all amazing. The green moss scrub is my favourite so far. The soaps lather really well and the scent last a long time.

Great natural soaps and amazing prices. Treat yourself!",5,2015-06-19 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Fantastic Company,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"This is the first review I have ever written; however, this company has caused me to take to my keyboard. The customer service level with Dr. Squatch is fantastic. I will start out by saying I am not a smart man and so I allow the google auto fill function to fill out address's for me. This is when disaster struck, in short it filled out the wrong address and my dreams of manly smells where crushed as my wayward soap made its way across the country to another man. I contacted the Dr. Squatch customer service and when I explained my tragedy, they quickly sent out a new package at no cost to me. I am doubly impressed as I am no long time customer and this was my first trial run with Dr. Squatch. I have since used the soap that was sent to me and I believe my sex appeal doubled and I have had to begin carrying a stick to beat women off of me. This is doubly impressive as it feels good to use this soap in the shower. On a serious note this company rocks and their soap is fantastic and their customer service is top notch. Keep it up team Squatch you have made a new long time customer.",5,2015-06-20 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Very nice,Pine Tar,"I bought this soap expecting it to last maybe 3 weeks, but it lasted almost double that. This is by far my favourite of all your soaps (all of them are nice!), and it seemed to last longer as well (maybe the oatmeal or something?). If you plan on buying this soap, make sure you have a soap saver, as the black soap leftovers can stick easily to surfaces and are hard to get out.

True,GREAT PRODUCT,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I have oily skin, so I have used Irish Spring almost exclusively because it dries my skin out. Dr. Squash soaps smell great, clean well, DON €:tm:T dry my skin but leave me feeling not oily at all. I have only used the Pine so far. My wife loves it. Smells great. Also smells manly. I have used the sample cologne in the box pack I got for Father €:tm:s day. Very masculine smell, wife loves it too.",5,2015-07-07 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Dear Dr Squatch,Cologne Samples,"Well my dear Squatchers in Squatchland.....you have made me into the squatchman I was always supposed to be. I've only been able to use the Pine tar soap, but in combination with either colognes, well ladies and gents, it is a doozy. I'm being smelled at the office, at parties, being passed around getting hugged since people are so curious at what permeates from my body. Like I read when I first was investigating the good Dr, look good feel good, and that starts from the skin up. I've used so many different body soaps (both bar and liquid) over the years and was still plagued with dry irritated skin. Not anymore. And since it's so kickass anyways I use it as shampoo and face wash....and my skin or hair have never felt better. No more dry skin. It feels softer and healthier. So the only real comment I have, oh Squatchers, is when will you come out with a deodorant? 
I enjoy changing scents on a daily basis and since it's oil based it seems to stay on longer than most all the other colognes I've spent too much money on. 
Ya'll have a Squatcher for life. Good work and PLEASE keep it up. Squatch out.",5,2015-07-07 04:00:00+00:00,70705703

True,soap review,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,I have only used one bar out of the four and that was the eucalyptus-yogurt bar. Its OK. Nothing special and lightly scented.

True,A Classic,Pine Tar,"Regrettably, I never got into baseball as a kid; nevertheless, Pine Tar brought back boyhood memories the minute I opened the box. There was a great old barn-turned-rec-center at a summer camp I attended and later worked at. The wood in that building was sealed with pine tar. I never knew what that classic scent was until I caught a whiff of this soap and was taken right back to some of the best summers of my life. I'm NOT saying you'll smell like an old barn if you use Pine Tar--this soap has a wonderfully refreshing, pungently sweet, but not overpowering scent. I am saying this soap packs an aromatic punch that evokes good ol' times of summers playing in the forest and spent at camp. Since the cigar/gift box arrived from Dr. Squatch, I've looked forward to hitting the shower each morning and really waking up with this ruggedly invigorating soap. It not only serves its primary purpose well--lathering up and cleaning great; it's also provides a (welcomed!) daily dose of thoroughly manly aromatherapy. There's a reason this is their best-seller; it's a classic. If you haven't tried it, don't put it off any longer!",5,2015-07-19 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,A Real Man's Fragrance,Crushed Pine,"This is the manliest cologne €¦EVER. Of mainstream fragrances, it most closely resembles Drakkar Noir, but it has a much earthier, woodsier soul. It smells less refined €”in a good way: clean but not soft, wild and yet sophisticated. It €:tm:s at once natural, essential, and complex. It hints of adventure and maturity, primal urges and quiet strength. I use this mostly in my beard €”just a little bit after my morning shower and shave. It refreshes and it stirs. It awakens something deep, exudes authentic masculinity, and conveys subtle but unmistakable confidence.",5,2015-07-19 04:00:00+00:00,86211176
True,Awesome soap.,Pine Tar,"I generally buy scent less soap, because I don't want to smell like a woman. Dr Squatch's Pine Tar is virile, it will bring out your inner man, like the woodsman you are supposed to be, I don't think I'll use anything else, period.",5,2015-07-20 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Loved it,Pine Tar,out if the 3 I got it was by far my favorite ! I was not disappointed but thought I'd like the gold moss more didn't really have a scent to me .

All joking aside, I seriously love your guys' products. How great is it that a product is made in the USA, very much affordable, and is a great smelling product for us guys? (not that your products are for men only, my girlfriend loves the smell of them too!) My favorite is the Deep Sea Goats Milk... although the gold moss scrub is a close, close second. 
 
Here's a testament for your product: 
I'm a blacksmith/bladesmith. I create things of steel, some being very sharp. I spend hours on top of hours working beside a hot coal forge, sweating with every hammer blow. When I finish working, I have black soot and grime all over me from the coal and metal. This stuff not only smells good, but it helps me scrub away all of that dirty crud and leave me clean, refreshed, and smelling dang good.

True,"I like them both, but I like being in the woods too",Cologne Samples,"My wife says the scents are nice but not flirtatious like. More of a scent you expect a friend or a family member to smell like. She like a more beach like floral scent. In all i'd say, personally I love them both. Brings me back to thinking about nature, hiking, jeeping, or just chilling along the lakeside. But I don't buy cologne to do that. I buy it so she jumps my bones. I'd recommend this to friends, but it's not going to be a big hit with their ladies unless they love the outdoors to the point that's all they dream about. I'd say it's really more of a 3.75 stars rating. Great scents, but just not the right purpose for my use.",3,2015-07-21 04:00:00+00:00,70705703
True,Awesome,Gold Moss,Great scent. I sometimes just pick the bar up for an uplift from the smell. Also love the Pine Tar smell.,5,2015-07-21 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
True,Super great manly scent for stepping out the shower,Pine Tar,"Makes you feel like you're bathing in the forest. I love the scent. I also like the Gold Moss too. My only complaint would be I wish I could get this same scent without all the exfoliation or possibly in a body wash. The scent is strong and a great way to wake up, but the abrasive texture makes my hesitate to buy again. But the scent brings me back kind of like wanting to pet a lion. I can't NOT recommend this product, it's just a great product with great ingredients but will do the extreme job of exfoliating if you're sensitive I would recommend Gold Moss instead.",5,2015-07-21 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Awesomest Soaps Evar,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"Seriously though. They smell great, the packaging is amazing, and I feel like the manliest man that ever lived after I step out of the shower. Buy this soap now.",5,2015-07-22 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
False,Do it a little better,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,You have to get better at what you do. My soap came broken because it was sent in a soft envelope. You have to protect the product.

True,Best Decision of my Life,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I, for the longest time used a brand that rhymes with Bold Slice. I liked the smell and the marketing was very clever. I always felt as though these other brands could not compete. My wife and I started to have kids and changed things in our lives including our diets (Gluten Free, Paleo) to her even starting to sell and use essential oils. Then we switched our toothpaste to natural toothpaste. Then she started using natural soap. I was not down with that. She wasn't going to separate me from Bold Slice. But After sometime, I came across your company. ""Manly"" natural soap??? Well, I decided to make a deal with my wife. I will use it and give it a try. She looked at the ingredients used and was on board. I still was in my head, not going to be convinced. But then my order arrived and the smell alone was phenomenal! So The next morning, I used the bay rum bar. My skin never felt so clean and never reacted to soap so positively before. I have had dry, itchy skin for some time now and the first day of using Dr. Squatch Bay Rum, no itch. I smelled good, felt good and I am pretty convinced that I look like Hercules due to your soap. (Well, maybe not the last part.) I am truly convinced that your soap is superior to all others and will only use your product. Thank you for being an unsuspecting hero in my house!",5,2015-07-23 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Purchased Spearmint Basil and Pine Tar soaps,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"While at first I was slightly disappointed with the fragrance of the pine tar soap--It was simply not ""piney"" enough for me--I quickly changed my mind oonce i used the soap for the first time. Never before has the skin on my face felt so smooth and natural, the Pine Tar soap is a real godsend when it comes to exfoliation. If you are someone like me, who has a history of facial blackheads, this may be the soap you've been waiting for. The Spearmint Basic Scrub is another wonderful product--if you like the smell of basil then this is definitely a soap you'll be a fan of. It's got a cool, slightly spicy smell to it and leaves me feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. I would highly recommend both of these soaps to anyone.",5,2015-07-28 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,My soap experience,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"so far, I like the scents, variety, packaging, and overall theme. A bit underwhelmed with the lifespan of the soap, the quality when it gets smaller (breaks too early and becomes useless) and the staining the woods soap saver has in the shower. Looks like the varnish runs for a few weeks before it is gone. Plan on trying some other types, but most organic soaps I have bought for the same price last longer than 7 days",3,2015-07-30 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Expectations Far Surpassed!,Best Sellers Gift Box,"I had wanted to try Dr. Squatch for some time. I took the €œPrescription Quiz €? and read reviews for the different soaps and colognes. I realized the Deluxe Gift Box was the most economical way to sample it all. Even so, initially I was reluctant to make the investment in this collection of products I €:tm:d only seen advertised online. Let me tell you, I AM SO GLAD I DID! The quality of the soaps, the fragrance, and the cigar box far exceeded my expectations. I €:tm:ve previously reviewed the Pine Tar soap and Hemlock Trail cologne €”both are classic, invigorating, masculine products! €”and I €:tm:m looking forward to lathering up with the Gold Moss, Bay Rum, and Cool Fresh Aloe soaps that also arrived in the Deluxe Gift Box. (I €:tm:ll review them when I get to them €”but these bars last a LONG time, which is awesome!) I want to comment here, though, on the box itself, because it €:tm:s what raises this from merely a set of outstanding personal care products to the kind of classy, timeless, souvenir that you could give to your groomsmen before a wedding, to your son at a milestone in his young adulthood, or to a father-figure in your life on a very special occasion. Mine arrived in an Alec Bradley Black Market (Toro) cigar box. Solid wood, the box was handmade in Honduras, features an antique-looking metal latch, and is decorated on the inside with faded, Old World-style shipping receipts. Opening the box feels like stepping back in time €¦, which kind of makes sense when you consider that everything Dr. Squatch makes is handcrafted using natural ingredients and traditional processes. Like everyone else, I enjoy my modern conveniences, but there €:tm:s something essential about touching, opening, and breathing in that which is authentic, grounded, and connected to ways of doing things and being in the world that are genuine, time-honored, and altogether worth remembering.",5,2015-08-02 04:00:00+00:00,81318210
True,It was good,Best Sellers Gift Box,"the scent a a bit light and pedestrian. I enjoyed the aloe mostly. I asked a friend for their thought on the oil and the response was ""Meh"".

True,Pine tar soap,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I just tried the Pine tar soap for the first time. I will say I like the smell. and the scent it leaves on you after a shower. and yes, it does leave a good scent in the bathroom as well. I will say the bar only lasted me a week. That is something I wanted to find out about, and my only negative thing to say about it. But after a week of using it, I did notice a difference in how my skin feels, and also how it seems to get rid of the ""old man smell"" I think I can now associate with using regular commercial brand bar soap, and the film it leaves on you. I have in the past used a hard mill natural soap before, and liked the way it lasted longer than regular soap. I started using the gold moss scrub tonight, and it has a great smell to it too. I will see how long it will last me, I hope longer than the pine tar, which I think I go through quick because I shower daily, and the exfoliants may make it more porous, but you do get a good scrubbing from it. Ask me in a week or two and I will give you my opinion of the Gold Moss. Now for the rest of my review, I will say this. I deal with people a lot, and I notice a lot of repetition of smells from guys, same type of smell, which seems to me to be overpowering, and I would say metrosexual feminine with no character. So far, I like the unique clean fragrance that doesn't smell like everybody else, and it's far from the overwhelming garbage I smell out there, these guys may as well be wearing tussy lol! I think subtle is much nicer than Hey I'm Here!",4,2015-08-06 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

Hot damn, I was impressed. It's a solid piece of wood, carved and ready for action. Not only does it make my bar of sweet action pine tar soap last longer, it gave me a tactical advantage in a fist fight. Ask the guy with no front teeth and breath with a hint of pine.

This soap really does feel better on my skin after a shower and i love the smells of all the bars of soap that I got in the gift box as well as the box itself. I think they're presentation really matches the quality of product they have made and so far I am really enjoying their soap. 
 
This isn't a negative only preference, but I would say as far as the bars of soap i got, i am not a huge fan of Pine Tar and the Eucalyptus Greek Yogurt only because they're much more coarse on my skin and i wasn't exactly prepared for that. They smell great, but they have sand and other stuff in them, so if you're not a big fan of that, then I would suggest not getting them.",5,2015-08-09 04:00:00+00:00,81318210

True,Why so soon?,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"The pine tar soap is AWESOME!! The only bad part about it was that it was gone just way too soon! It only lasted through 6 showers. $1 per shower. I was a bit disappointed that it didn't last very long, but my skin felt great after the shower. Great product, just wish it would last longer. Maybe that's cuz it doesn't have all the chemicals in it?",4,2015-08-09 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,"Love the scent, love the feel, but hate the short timeframe.",Pine Tar,"I bought this and received it on Thursday. I love the way my skin feels after using it. It is very cleansing and has a similar feel to Lava soap (but without all the chemicals you can't pronounce). The smell was great. I have to admit it took me a couple minutes to get used to it, but it really smells awesome! I would say the downside, and why I can't give it 5 stars is that it doesn't last very long. I got it Thursday (today is sunday), and it already is down like 30% from it's original size. I just wish they could somehow make this one last longer. I assume the oatmeal and sand is why it doesn't last as long.",3,2015-08-09 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,I like it but....,Cedar Citrus,Soap smells great but it just doesn't last too long. This does not dry my skin out like most soaps. I use it for both body and face. I do not need the soap saver that they push on the site. My shower rack already has one. I'd buy again for the great product but they could give a bigger bar for what you pay for. One bar lasted about 13-14 days.,4,2015-08-10 04:00:00+00:00,70701577

This soap will completely blow your senses (in a good way) to a whole new level. The reason I gave this 4 stars is because I don €:tm:t see anywhere that states if this soap is anti-bacterial or not.

True,Smells like Pine,Pine Tar,"I have used pine tar soaps before, and decided to try this one out. This soap does not have a tarry smell at all. I think the best description would be it smells like a pine candle, but in a good way. It is strong, but not overpowered. I feel truly clean too.

True,"Pine Tar Soap, the best soap I have ever purchased.",Pine Tar,"I have purchased Dr.Squatch soap before,but heard great reviews about pine tar as a great scent and exfoliating soap, specifically for bearded men. When I opened the mailbox, the smell hit me like a truck. It was very strong pine almost like pine sol. Once I opened it up I realized this was definitely some powerful stuff. I had to try it, right away. Me and my wife were arguing lightly about something ridiculous before I hit the shower, when I got out she came in and the smell stopped the argument. She said how much she liked it, even better than the Gold Moss, which was my personal favorite before. I have a full beard,and it softens it and detangles.it doesn't have the long lasting scent I thought it would, at least that I can tell,but it definitely does a great job as far as a beard soap goes. I would recommend this soap to anyone with a longer beard, or who loves the pleasent refreshing smell of pine tar. It does leave a lot of black in the shower, but it rinses right away. The manliest, best working, natural soap I have ever purchased and I will be buying more, my kids love to use it too. Get yours now!!!",5,2015-08-26 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

True,Coast Guard Flight Mechanic Endorsed,Gold Moss,"I fell in love with this soap after one use. I get covered in sweat, sea spray, oil, grease, grim, and other various hazardous materials all day, every day at work. This stuff left me feeling clean and the smell is fantastic. I was a little hesitant to try a bar soap due to previous experience with drying skin with run of the mill products, but after just having it in the shower for the first few minutes I was hooked. Definitely looking at a long time customer here.",5,2015-08-29 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
True,As good as advertised,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"After reading multiple reviews and learning a little about the company, I decided to try a couple of the products (the Bay Rum and Gold Moss soaps and the cologne sampler as well). These products were all as good as advertised- the very definition of ""getting what you paid for"". I used the Gold Moss as shaving cream and it worked like a charm! My skin felt clean without any of the dryness that I often feel after using soap. The Bay Rum keeps me and the bathroom smelling nice as well. The colognes are straightforward and masculine without being heavy-handed. All in all, I am very pleased by purchase.

True,Saves my soap!,Soap Saver,"I love my Dr. Squatch soap, and I want it to last as long as possible. Just throwing them wherever isn't an option for me. I looked at some other fancy soap dishes, but the Sasquatchian size of the bar requires an equally mighty place to store my soap after each use. The Dr. Squatch soap saver fits the bill perfectly. My soaps sit nicely on top of it, and the pleasant smell of cedar from the Soap Saver compliments any bar that I happen to be using at the time. If you've made the investment in the soap, ensure it lasts as long as possible and get yourself a Soap Saver. It's worth it!",5,2015-08-31 04:00:00+00:00,70698419

True,Slightly over rated,Pine Tar,"Scent was not nearly what was expected, tended to be a little weak, but masculine. Exfoliation ability second to none! Durability of the bar was poor.

True,"Great soaps, great scents.",Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I love the scent of the soaps, i also got some of the hemlock grove cologne - its an oil, but pricey and really small. 
 
I still like and recommend the products. It would be great if bars were larger (for price) or it was available via amazon, so i could save on the shipping. 
 
I'm still giving it a high rating because not only are the scents right on the money (but need a new one: sage, oregano and bear haha) and they dont contain ANY poison or unnatural crap. 
 
A natural deodorant from them would be awesome too, i'd buy it.",4,2015-09-05 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews

True,Excellent products €”poor quality control! :o(,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I like all the products I €:tm:ve tried but the quality control seems to be falling apart. 1) I bought a cedar soap holder. It looked like something I could make in my shop in about 2 minutes (rough, crude manufacture & finish) then my soap stuck to it and peeled off the top layers of some of the bars in the form of pungee-stick-like splinters! 
2) Most recent bar of the Pine Tar Soap (my favorite) felt like the abrasive grit was going to take my skin off! (don €:tm:t remember the first bar being this rough) 
3) I paid $7 for two different samples of the cologne and got two of the same thing €”the one I already owned!

True,Good soap. Questionable Value.,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"I love this soap! The pine tar and golden moss especially. It's hard to find good quality soap for men and the good Dr didn't disappoint. My only pain point was the size of the bar. It's 5oz. In my opinion that's a chick's size soap bar. For this price it should be larger. At this PP I would expect a bar closer to 10oz. I would pay $10 for a 15oz bar and would keep coming back repeatedly. I remember a decade or so ago when The Body Shop carried something called a ""milk bar"". It was an oversized bar of soap made from goat's milk. It was abut $9 and probably 20oz or so. I cried the day it was discontinued. I hope you continue to grow.

True,Pleased with both use and results,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"This is my first experience with buying and using a bar of soap specifically intended for a beard. The soap performs well from providing an easy lather to rinsing off. It has a pleasant fragrance all its own, but it is not the ""Irish Spring"" scent at all. Best of all, my skin beneath the beard does not get soap residue nor itch. A very positive experience and as a *stand-alone experiment of sorts, I highly recommend it.

False,Diggin the Squatch,Dr. Squatch Favorites Pack,"Bought the favorites bundle (soap saver, pine tar, gold moss scrub and Citrus). Have been using the Gold moss and I'm lovin it.

My skin does not feel dried out like it does at times using regular bar soap. Can't wait to try the other two and possibly more! 
The only negative comment (and the reason I only gave 4 instead of 5 stars) is that the soap seems to not last as long as you would think paying $5-$6 a bar. Other than that, I love it!",4,2015-10-06 04:00:00+00:00,203407568

Great product!",5,2015-10-06 04:00:00+00:00,83121848
False,Disappointed with this one...,Cedar Citrus,"I am a new customer and ordered three bars to start. Really, really liked the Gold Moss, though I do wish that the scent would remain a little stronger. Still, it is listed as ""mild"" in that category, so that's fine. This one, though, is rated as a ""medium."" Out of the package and when it's in use, the bar smells great. But once I'm done with the shower, I can't smell it at all. Granted, I don't smell like fumunda cheese and onions so I guess it's doing the job of cleaning, but there's no lingering scent at all. I expected the scent to be stronger than that of the Gold Moss and was surprised to find that it's basically non-existent. Will buy Gold Moss again, and plan to try the Bay Rum next, but I won't be getting this one again.",2,2015-10-06 04:00:00+00:00,70701577

False,"Difficult to load, but overall great!",Shave Bar,"Dr Squatch's Shave Bar is a unique smelling soap with a great masculine scent of clay, mint and a very nice citrus hint at the end that stays with you after the shave.

During the time of this shave I had two weeks facial hair growth, a new Persona blade in a Phoenix DOC Safety Razor.

I do have to say at the beginning using this soap while blooming it I was almost about to give up, there is a certain way that this soap needs to be lathered. If you fail to lather it in the way that it is designed to you will be very disappointed in the results.

This soap is a very hard soap to lather if you do not know what you are doing. If are used to a wet brush and blooming your soap this soap will cause you to change your habits. This soap does not like excess water, if you use too much water you will be very disappointed to see the result, that result being a foamy lather. When the soap is applied onto the face correctly with minimal water you are going to have to hydrate the soap roughly 45 seconds to a minute in order to keep it as a cream, if you choose not to it will dry out on your face. I also noticed that this soap works better with a smaller boar size brush due to the size of the puck being 4.5 oz. My best result was with an Omega 46065 boar brush with a face lather. I also tried with a 30mm knot Whipped Dog High Mountain Badger brush and a Esccali badger brush, the soap worked great in both a face and bowl lather although I would recommend a bowl lather as it is a lot easier to see the reaction of the soap and add water.

When this soap is loaded correctly the soap is a great soap, with a strong masculine smell and glide that it supplies could be a soap I would turn to on a regular shaving basis. I would be reluctant to use this soap while shaving a longer growth just because of how much attention has to be applied to the consistency of the soap, if there is too much or too less water you will not enjoy the shave. I would not recommend this soap for newcomers to the art of traditional shaving just because of all the factors that come into play. Price of this soap is 12$ for 4.5 ounces that puts the cost as 2.66$ per ounce which is beyond fair in my eyes.

Loading ability of this soap is going to be lower due to just how picky it is for this soap to form a good lather. I will give it a 4 out of 10.

Peaks with this soap are very nice and deserve nothing less than a 8 out of 10.

Gliding ability with this soap is a 7 out of 10.

Scent of this soap would receive a 9 out of 10.

Overall this soap would receive a 7 out of 10.

Of course I always would recommend a good pre-shave to help with the gliding ability.",4,2015-10-07 04:00:00+00:00,83120728

False,"Great soap, awesome smell, feels great!",Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"This soap was amazing. The texture, smell, and quality are all perfect. I have always struggled with a small amount of acne/blemishes on my shoulders and back and decided to finally buy a natural soap to try and help this situation. Dr. Squatch cleared everything up in about 5 days. The grit is just right to rough up the skin and exfoliate, without being painful or abrasive. I hate to follow up such a positive 5 star review with a complaint, but the size is just too small for the price. The one bar lasted me less than 3 weeks. It's possible that I did indulge as I used it to scrub my face and (hairless) head every day too, but even if I could get a full month out of a bar, $9 is a bit too much as a monthly expense for soap. I fully realize that this is a premium product, and the product is fantastic, but it may just be that it's a little out of my budget.

The Pine Tar is fantastic, a bit scratchy though. It does leave a residue wherever it sits.

False,Soaps I have tried so far;,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,"The Bay Rum is my favorite I believe. I really like the smell and so does my wife. She didn't care for the Gold Moss. Using the Bay Rum reminds me of my childhood and getting Old Spice or one of those type products from my old fashioned Great Aunt. I know it sounds corny, but using this soap reminds me of a past when things were more ""manly"". It is a man's type smell and the soap just works so much better for showering than the other commercial made soaps. I used to use Lever 2000, but won't buy any of those again. Dr. Squatch is a superior product to any of the name brand soaps purchased in stores. You step out of the shower feeling good and clean and you smell like a man should. 
My next favorite and very close second is the Pine Tar. I didn't know what to think when I saw the black color but immediately enjoyed the smell and the coarse texture. It is a great soap. I may have to keep two bars in the shower at a time and switch back and forth. The Pine smell is great! Reminds you of the outdoors. (I have an outdoor shower too). The coarse texture reminds me of the old Lava brand soap my father used to keep out on the utility room sink for washing dirty hands. Great scrubbing ability, (we won't use the exfoliation word) or any other feminine terminology. The Pine Tar really cleans well and leaves you feeling fresh when you finish your shower. Awesome product! 
Using the Goats Milk, Sea salt now. I'll fill you in later. I used to have Dairy goats and my wife made a milk soap and would add ground up egg shells for texture, so I'm interested to try your sea salt version. 
Thanks guys",5,2015-10-26 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,Even good for old guys.,Pine Tar,"I avoided this soap for months, thinking it was produced by and marketed to only the younger hipsters with full beards. I'm past 50 now and as far from hip as I can be. I worry about things like death and taxes. But I like to smell good too. I relented and picked up a couple bars. The Pine Tar was up first, and it blew me away. The smell reminded me of my old trout fishing cabin from my youth. Once my reminiscences of a #18 Olive Dun subsided, I realized how fresh and non-filmy I felt. My wife greeted me at the bathroom door (THAT never happens) and said, ""You smell good."" She's smelled me plenty of other ways without commenting, so that was a bit miraculous on it's own. She rubbed my arm and said, ""And you're soft too."" Since my kids might end up reading this, I'll dispense with further annotations. Suffice it to say, I haven't enjoyed taking a shower this much since my teenage years.",5,2015-10-26 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

False,amazing soap,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,The Sop smells amazing and makes my skin feel refreshed and soft. Never felt as clean as i do until started using your soaps for a while now. Love the products. Keep up the amazing soap making,5,2016-04-24 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,"Best ever, and my newborn loves the smell",Pine Tar,Good stuff,5,2016-05-19 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Addicted to the way this smells!,Pine Tar,"The abrasive feel of this soap was a little strong at first but I love the way it removes any dirt, grease, or dead skin from sun exposure. After a few days of using it, I'm addicted. I can't describe the smell... it's like sticking your nose inside a pine tree, but with a slight soapy clean smell too. This is the first bar Ive pulled out of my box containing 5 more soaps. I hope I like them all this much!",5,2016-09-09 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Amazing!,Pine Tar,"A previous review writer wrote that this bar of pine tar soap turns your weak human membrane into yeti armor. That couldn't be more true.. I've only showered with it once and already notice a difference in the smoothness and strength of my skin. The scent is beyond addicting. If I had one suggestion, I'd like the bar to produce even more of a scent than it already does because I just can't get enough of it. Superb quality here.... In fact, I started a subscription and backed their kick starter for their up and coming shampoo and conditioner right after I jumped out of the shower. 

You're onto something really special with these products.. I'm glad to see you're producing new lines of product as well. May I propose a fan request? Deodorant!",5,2016-10-09 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,"Good, If You Start Properly...",Soap Saver,"I came across the negative reviews as my soap saver was en route. When I received mine, I noticed two things: 1) it's REALLY lightweight, and 2) I decided to coat the top in a thin layer of olive oil to prevent the sticking complaint that was a recurring theme in the reviews.

Long story short, the soap doesn't stick whatsoever! However, when you read the description and see that this is crafted from California cedar, you get this image of a wooden brick that can look at home in a forest - pretty manly image, right?

Well, this thing feels like it's made of balsa wood. If it had a little more heft, it might command the $15 price tag. If mine didn't come in the sampler, I'd be ticked for spending that much for something that feels so 'limp.'

Overall, not bad!",4,2016-10-12 04:00:00+00:00,70698419
False,"Not what expected, extremely strong perfume sent.",Pine Tar,"I like the idea and feel of a all natural soap that lathers up nicely and has NATURAL sent. Unfortunately this soap has all of the above except a natural sent. The pine tar should smell smokey and piney, but it smell like perfume. If this soap had no added ""fragrances"" it would be exactly what I'm looking for.",2,2016-10-12 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,Smells too much like toothpaste,Spearmint Basil,Too spearminty for my taste and not enough basil. Makes me feel like I'm brushing my teeth. Nice texture to the soap though.,2,2016-10-14 04:00:00+00:00,70701388
True,Nice smell but a bit aggressive on the pumice,Pine Tar,"The smell is great, very woodsy and manly. The pumice is a bit too rough and makes it feel like it may scrape up the skin in some tender areas (underside of arms, face).",4,2016-10-14 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Short lived,Pine Tar,"This is great soap, dont get me wrong. The scent and exfoliation is very good. It rinses easy and leaves my skin feeling clean without a film. However, this bar has only lasted a week from daily showers. When the bar reached about a 1/2 inch in thickness, it broke into 4 small pieces. I'm a little put off about this. Please make these last longer as $6/week for a bar of soap is a little excessive.",3,2016-10-16 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Awesome!,Gold Moss,Gold Moss Scrub is my first bar from Dr. Squatch. I love it! The scent is awesome and lingers long after the shower. I'm hooked and just increased the # of bars in my subscription. Can't wait to try them all!,5,2016-10-22 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
True,Simply Amazing,Cedar Citrus,"I got this soap as a ""Squatch Pick"" for my very first order. I love the scent. It's not overpoweringly cedar so you don't smell like a hamster cage, but it's present and melds nicely with the citrus. The mint was detected mostly when I used this bar soap as a shampoo. I could feel the tingling sensation on my scalp. Mild to moderate scent intensity which is actually a good thing for a nice, every day scent. Definitely a manlier and more adult scent than store bought mass produced soap and my skin is left feeling incredible and thoroughly clean. I can't wait to try all the other kinds of soaps as well!",5,2016-10-23 04:00:00+00:00,70701577
True,I really want to like it,Pine Tar,"I bought The pine Tar soap and had high expectations. But unfortunately for the price the soap does not last very long, just about a week at 2 showers a day and that's removing the bar from the shower after each use and storing it in a container. I can't speak on behalf of any of their other soaps as I have not tried them but the pine tar did have a rejuvenating feel after use and smelled great. But for the money In good conscience I just can't recommend the product.",2,2016-10-23 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Very good,Pine Tar,Exfoliates and smells great. Only complaint is the black might stain your shower if you aren't careful. Not a problem if you rinse it off.,5,2016-10-25 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,A lovely and manly scent!,Bay Rum,"Second scent I've tried so far and love it! After a few uses I'd definitely say I prefer the pine tar more. But that doesn't mean the bay rum is anything short of amazing; it also has an extremely addictive scent, while working hard to give you the best clean, while leaving your skin healthy and smooth when the shower is done. Two squatchy thumbs up!",5,2016-10-25 04:00:00+00:00,70700670
True,Pine tar is America,Pine Tar,America,5,2016-10-26 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Top 3,Nautical Sage,"This scent is awesome, and definitely goes head-to-head with the Gold Moss. I'd definitely say it's one of the best offerings by Dr. Squatch.",5,2016-10-26 04:00:00+00:00,112874164
True,First bar of Pine Tar and there will be more.,Pine Tar,Lathers great and makes your skin feel great. LONG LASTING sent as well. I'm hooked. Great product.,5,2016-10-27 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,Disappointed,Soap Saver,Very disappointed in my $15 block of wood. My soap sticks to it worse than just leaving it on my wire shower caddy. A waste of $15 that got by me being in my shopping cart when I started my subscription. Love the soap though but this thing may become kindling.,1,2016-10-28 04:00:00+00:00,70698419
True,Good Soap,Gold Moss,This bar has a nice scent with a very minimal scrubbing to it. The salt is a nice addition to it as a subtle scrub bar. Soap has a nice scent that isn't very strong. Overall good moss is an ok bar but not there best.,3,2016-10-30 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
True,Clean Soap!,Pine Tar,This bar has the most aggressive exfoliation additives to it and is one of my go to bars for when I travel. Lasts a long time and will clean you up no matter how smelly or dirty you are. Pine tar also gives you the cleanest feel and has a very strong pine scent which isn't over powering or not welcomed. It's scent backs up what it does. Cleanest feel and scent from this for sure. Awesome soap!,4,2016-10-30 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,Weak soap,Nautical Sage,Didn't like this soap at all. Scent is very weak. I couldnt get the cypress scent or sage from the bar as advertised. It's very subtle and to me was way too subtle to where I didn't enjoy it. Did well cleaning and not drying out skin.,2,2016-10-30 04:00:00+00:00,112874164
True,Man soap for sure!!,Bay Rum,Awesome scent! It's not that normal alcohol scent like you expect from bay rum. It's very well balanced with its spicy notes from the cinnamon and the orange zest. The pine gives it that twist that makes it really manly scented. Very smooth bar that lathers up well with a loofa or wash cloth. This bar has a scent that also lingers on you after your done using it the longest. Great bar for sure!,5,2016-10-30 04:00:00+00:00,70700670
True,Nautical sage,Nautical Sage,"been using this for just over a week now...love the smell very vibrant. Wife likes this one the most so far
I do wish the smell lingered after the shower....I guess it rinses to clean to leave any scent behind....",5,2016-11-02 04:00:00+00:00,112874164
True,I'm a girl and I love this stuff... Plus almost nothing else helps my psoriasis!,Pine Tar,"I am a female with extremely dry, sensitive skin, and recently had a pretty bad bout of psoriasis. I typically avoid things such as bar soaps or anything with exfoliating qualities, and opt for more soothing, gentler cleansers. I was lucky enough to work with the Dr. Squatch team on a project and they were kind enough to send a bar of the Pine Tar soap home with me. I must have been feeling particularly adventurous that evening, and gave the somewhat masculine scented, exfoliating, bar soap a try in the shower- and boy oh boy, my skin thanked me. The natural exfoliation helped eliminate a lot of the dryness from my psoriasis and the natural qualities of the soap had an immediate soothing effect. After a few days of using this product, I could see a noticeable improvement in the appearance and feel of my psoriasis, and my skin felt softer and healthier overall. I've spent thousands of dollars looking for prescription and natural products that would give even the slightest improvement to my psoriasis, and this is one of the best I've found yet! HUGE FAN of both this soap, and the Dr. Squatch guys! Thanks again!!!",5,2016-11-03 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Fantastic!!,Cedar Citrus,I just bought the Cedar citrus and the Eucalyptus Greek Yogurt this week. Both are great smelling and leave your skin feeling awesome and smelling good at the same time. I will definitely be a return customer!!,5,2016-11-06 04:00:00+00:00,70701577
True,Very Soft Brush!!,Shave Brush,"This brush is very nice! For a synthetic style brush I really like this. The body of the bristles have a nice tight feel to it and the ends of the bristles are VERY soft. The ends really work up a lather and the body of the bristles doesn't lose its shape or get knotted up. It stays firm, maintains its shape, and gets a lather built up very quickly. Highly recommended!",5,2016-11-06 04:00:00+00:00,83120574
True,Very good,Eucalyptus Yogurt,This is a very good product !,5,2016-11-06 04:00:00+00:00,70700416
True,Nice Soap!!!,Deep Sea Goats Milk,"Deep Sea Goats milk is a really nice soap that is well balanced in regards to moisturization and exfoliation for my skin. The soap lathers extremely thick and creamy as it feels like your literally putting milk on your skin. Its a very smooth soap application that rinses off very easily which in turn leaves my skin very clean feeling with no dryness at all. This soap is very good for anyone starting to grow a thick beard as the goat milk will help keep the itch and dryness away! Its also very good if you have dry skin or you want a soap bar to wash your hair without drying it out or needing a conditioner for it. 

I also like the oatmeal they put in there as it has a nice gentle scrub to it. If you have water that has ""hard"" properties to it then this soap will help your skin feel right after you take a shower! The only thing I didn't like about this soap (and its not a deal breaker) is the scent. Smells VERY floral with a hint of woodsy scent to it (not sure exactly what it is for the woodsy fragrance). The scent reminds me of clean linens for some reason. The scent in my opinion is more feminine and the woodsy additions make the soap lean a bit more towards the manly side. Overall if your looking for a soap for your lady or you want a moisturizing soap that gives you that clean smooth feel then this soap will do the trick!",4,2016-11-07 04:00:00+00:00,70699496
True,Third selection and not a bad bar in the bunch,Spearmint Basil,"Just started on my final bar of my first subscription order - the Spearmint Basil. This is another good body bar - no need for a cloth or loofa, just use the soap. Like the Cedar Citrus, it's a great lather producer but I think the lather is more rich with this bar - it's more creamy than it is foamy. That combined with the great Spearmint scent makes for an invigorating morning shower. Can't wait to try three more in my next shipment.",5,2016-01-21 04:00:00+00:00,70701388
True,"Bar Number Two, Also Great but Different",Cedar Citrus,"Just started on this bar, the second in my subscription (the first was Pine Tar, which I really liked). This one is nice too. It also has a great scent and make my skin feel great. As winter has started I've really appreciated the way these soaps don't dry my skin. This bar is a real lather producer, much more so than the Pine Tar. It's also a nice body bar, meaning you can use just the bar to bathe with, no need to lather up a loofa or cloth. I couldn't really do that with the Pine Tar because of the strong exfoliation elements it has. That may be the best selling point for this one.",5,2015-12-31 04:00:00+00:00,70701577
True,Love this soap!,Pine Tar,"Just got my first subscription order and tried the Pine Tar bar first. I love the smell of this soap and the way it makes my skin feel. However, take them seriously when they say it's exfoliating, it will take your skin off if you're not careful where and how vigorously you use it! Will order more of this one going forward though, its good stuff. Looking forward to trying the other scents.",5,2015-11-29 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Amazing scent,Gold Moss,"I just ordered the Gold Moss and Deep Sea Goat's Milk as stocking stuffers for the boyfriend. He's used Dr. Squatch soap before and loved it. These smell amazing, I can't wait for him to try them out. (If he doesn't like them, I'll keep them for myself)",5,2015-12-17 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
True,The best (so far...),Spearmint Basil,I've used four of the scents and so far this one is by far my favorite. It leaves my bathroom smelling fresh and minty. Cleans and lathers well and leaves the skin feeling smooth. I am a soapscriber and I get two bars per month. I will continue getting this one on a monthly basis. Excellent product!,5,2016-07-05 04:00:00+00:00,70701388
True,Great Clean Feeling!,Cedar Citrus,"Cedar Citrus us very refreshing. Of the four bars that I have sampled, this has the most unique scent. It leaves my skin feeling and smelling clean and smooth. This is one of only two varieties they carry in our local stores and I can see why it's so popular. Great lather without leaving residue like the Pine Tar.",5,2016-07-05 04:00:00+00:00,70701577
True,Great Scent,Bay Rum,"I am working my way through all of the Squatch scents, one bar at a time. I began using the Bay Rum yesterday and I was expecting Old Spice from what other reviewers were saying. I opened it up and used this and thought it was very pleasant. I think Old Spice is much stronger. This was a nice mix of spice, cedar and pine (and all three are present when you smell it). It is similar to the other soaps in that it cleans well and leaves my skin feeling soft. I am not an old man and this didn't make me feel or smell like an old man after using it. I didn't get any complaints from the ladies either. I think this is a keeper and will likely become a regular in my soapscription.",4,2016-07-29 04:00:00+00:00,70700670
True,Great Clean Feeling!,Nautical Sage,"I don't know why Nautical Sage is getting poor reviews because I think this one has a great scent. I can definitely detect the sage and the lavender. They come together to make a lovely scent which isn't too overpowering but also isn't girly. This was the 8th of the nine bars in the line that I've tried. I'd say it's middle of the pack, but the lather is fabulous and I feel really nice and clean and fresh and manly and super and wonderful. Next Up: Eucalyptus Greek Yogurt",4,2016-09-02 04:00:00+00:00,112874164
True,Not as girly as I expected it to be,Gold Moss,"When I first smelled this in the box I wasn't sure I was going to like it. It smelled a little too ""perfume-y"" for my liking. After breaking it out and using it, I really do like it. The smell is actually not bad and it cleans really well. This bar lasted longer than the Pine Tar and about as long as the Citrus Cedar. Nice, refreshing feeling after using it and it has great lather. I like it.",4,2016-07-02 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
True,great for body and beard,Deep Sea Goats Milk,First off I want to say if there is a negative review about a products smell that has nothing to do with the quality of the soap...that's personal choice....now on to the goats milk soap... I have tried a few other bars but by far this is my favorite lathers up well so u don't have to use as much plus it makes my beard very soft...the others I tried were great but kinda didn't hit home what I was looking for in a beard wash as well as body...this is one ...i'll be buying this again...also the customer service is second to none here...just ask they will try to help u...well hpe this helps someone decide on a soap,5,2016-04-15 04:00:00+00:00,70699496
True,Best soap ever,Spearmint Basil,I want to say this the best smelling soap my wife likes the pine tar I love spearmint and basil love the bay rum super soap,5,2016-06-05 04:00:00+00:00,70701388
True,Heaven,Bay Rum,"Yes yes yes the smell is amazing, feels great on my skin, this is 1 I will not stop buying for sure",5,2016-08-19 04:00:00+00:00,70700670
True,Green green,Cool Fresh Aloe,"Feels great, not to powerful of a smell, But it does smell nice, and it's great for the skin",5,2016-08-19 04:00:00+00:00,70699856
True,From Skin to Armor,Pine Tar,Turns your weak gross human skin into thick smooth Yeti armor. 10/10 would bath again,5,2016-09-20 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Excellent woodsy scent; natural but not overpowering,Crushed Pine,I enjoy wearing this scent very much. Used to swear by Drakkar; but I'm finding Hemlock Trail accents my Pine Tar soap wonderfully. It has a very earthy and masculine scent; Pine and Cedar are really prominent. It's not overpowering; and smells very genuine; like a summer day deep in the woods.,5,2016-01-16 04:00:00+00:00,86211176
True,Never felt better.,Dr. Squatch Favorites Pack,"I am almost done with my second bar of Dr. Squatch soap, and my skin has never felt better. I absolutely love this soap. i recommend it to all my friends!",5,2016-05-14 04:00:00+00:00,203407568
True,I guess that's why we have options!!!,Nautical Sage,I really like nautical sage. I've now tried all the soaps and it's probably my third favorite (tied with pine tar) behind Goat's Milk and Gold Moss. It probably lathers the best of all the varieties. I get 2 of each on my subscription.,5,2016-09-09 04:00:00+00:00,112874164
True,A walk through the woods . . .,Gold Moss,"I spend a lot of time in the woods; hiking, camping, hunting and scouting. Most of the time I try to ""de-scent"" so as not to scare off my querry. This soap smells so natural and so much like the woods near where I live and play, I can start my trip feeling clean. I work in the foodservice industry and in a fast paced kitchen it is hard to stay smelling clean. At the end of being hot and sweaty and being splashed with hot grease and dirty dishwater I still smell manly and clean. Many of my female co-workers have commented on how good it smells. Gold Moss has it going on, and Dr. Squatch is freekin' awesome! It's about time someone takes the ""art of manliness"" seriously. I smell great and not like some teenage kid who smells like a flower bed. This is some great stuff. Gold Moss is definitely a keeper.",5,2016-04-14 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
True,Good soap,Gold Moss,"I recently purchased the sampler bundle and have begun using this soap. It smells good and lathers up nicely. It keeps me clean and my skin smooth. This is not my favorite in the sampler bundle, but it is a good soap.",4,2016-05-17 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
True,Great Soap,Cedar Citrus,I really like this soap. It has a great smell and leaves me feeling clean. Since I started using this soap my skin is smoother and the dry rough spots on my elbows have disappeared. I have no need for lotions or anything like that anymore.,5,2016-05-17 04:00:00+00:00,70701577
True,I like it,Soap Saver,"Yes, the soap sticks to the soap saver. But, it can be easily removed by pushing the soap from one side, and it will pop right off. I've also found that rinsing the soap saver before you put your soap back helps keep it free of residue build up. I really it!",5,2016-09-02 04:00:00+00:00,70698419
True,Gets me going,Dr. Squatch Favorites Pack,"My skin feels great and I feel clean, I get up at 0400 HRS for work and the smells alone help me wake up in a better mood.",5,2016-06-29 04:00:00+00:00,203407568
True,Mintastic!,Spearmint Basil,"I have tried and enjoyed many of the Squatch scents, but the spearmint basil is definitely a big winner! So glad that I decided to give it a try, I am still a big gold moss fan but this is definitely a great scent to put in the rotation.",5,2016-06-10 04:00:00+00:00,70701388
True,Soap saver works,Soap Saver,"I ordered the 3 bar sample pack with the soap saver. The first bar is still going strong after a week and a half. The soap saver does allow the bar to dry after each shower, it does stick but I haven't found it to be keeping any soap behind yet. I was concerned about the average bar life and this is better than the average I've read about here. Looking at subscribing when I get low. Great products for someone who can't handle the mass produced soaps found at the stores.",4,2016-03-26 04:00:00+00:00,70698419
True,Addicted to the way this smells!,Pine Tar,"The abrasive feel of this soap was a little strong at first but I love the way it removes any dirt, grease, or dead skin from sun exposure. After a few days of using it, I'm addicted. I can't describe the smell... it's like sticking your nose inside a pine tree, but with a slight soapy clean smell too. This is the first bar Ive pulled out of my box containing 5 more soaps. I hope I like them all this much!",5,2016-08-06 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Second time's the charm,Nautical Sage,"Bottom line up front - order a second bar! I felt the same way the negative reviewers did the first time I got this scent. It smelled like nothing and I was very disappointed. I think, perhaps, there was a bad batch in which they forgot to add some key ingredients. However, I forgot to update my scent preference on my subscription the next month and got another bar. This one was WAY different. The scent was exactly what I had been hoping for the first time. Strong sage notes and very refreshing. It's one of my favorites now. Give it a second chance!",5,2016-04-26 04:00:00+00:00,112874164
True,Best Ever,Pine Tar,"Arrived yesterday so I took a second shower. Besides the manly smell, I could tell how clean i felt. Then it rinses away without any of the usual ""can't get it off"" feeling. Best part today it has my whole bathroom smelling great.",5,2016-06-03 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Best soap ever,Gold Moss,Gold Moss and Aloe are my two favorites. I will never go back to commercial soap again. My skin thanks me.,5,2016-08-30 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
True,"Good Lather, Mellow Aroma",Gold Moss,"This is a good bar of soap that lathers well, moisturizes well, and smells pleasant. It's not a strong smell and doesn't linger beyond the shower.",4,2016-04-19 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
True,Amazing Scent and by far My Favorite!,Bay Rum,"The scent of this soap is perfect and leads to a fantastic showering experience. My wife loves this soap as well, not because she uses it, but because our bathroom now smells like Bay Rum. It's not an overpowering scent but it does stay with you which I love. It's a classy smell and not a cheap, Axe type of smell. You will not be disappointed with this bar of soap.",5,2016-04-19 04:00:00+00:00,70700670
True,MOST DETAILED REVIEW EVER,Deep Sea Goats Milk,"I've been a fan of specialty soaps for about a year now, and a believer in Sasquatch for most of my life (we have hair and blood DNA, afterall). I saw Dr. Squatch pop up on my Facebook page numerous times, and on about the 100th time, I decided to look at the web site. I became a ""6-Bar a-Quarter"" Soapscriber, to save money. The last soap I chose for my soapscription this quarter was the Deep Sea Goats Milk. And, wouldn't you know it, it was the one my girlfriend think smelled the best, saying, ""It smells like how a man is supposed to smell."" I actually blindfolded her and did a scent type playoffs with the soaps, with the playoff brackets included, and the Goats Mike won. In my opinion, I like the smell of all 6 I received this time. They're all unique. I've used this bar about 2-1/2 weeks now, and it should be gone by the end of this week. I read on the site that you can even use the Goats Milk soap to wash your hair and beard, so that's exactly what I did. My hair came out really clean and my beard ca",5,2016-06-21 04:00:00+00:00,70699496
True,Don't hesitate - Buy it!,Cedar Citrus,Was skeptical about $7 bar soap. In a week it has exceeded my expectations and is the best stuff I've used. Tip of the cap to Dr Squatch.,5,2016-08-16 04:00:00+00:00,70701577
True,LOVE! LOVE! LOVE!,Dr. Squatch Favorites Pack,Got these for my husband last Christmas and loved them so much we do the monthly subscription. He smells so good! I actually even prefer these soaps and use them as well! They have now become a must have at our house!,5,2015-12-15 04:00:00+00:00,203407568

True,DEEP SEA GOATS MILK,Deep Sea Goats Milk,Smells good and feel incredible. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and moisturized. My wife will actually touch my feet after showering with this soap.,5,2015-12-22 04:00:00+00:00,70699496
True,EUCALYPTUS GREEK YOGURT,Eucalyptus Yogurt,"Love the way my skin felt afterwards but the smell is not my favorite, and that's probably a matter of preference more than anything.",4,2015-12-22 04:00:00+00:00,70700416
True,Great bar,Cool Fresh Aloe,Breaks up the oil well and doesn't irritate eczema. Leaves me clean and comfortable.,5,2016-07-29 04:00:00+00:00,70699856
True,"It works, just needs some love",Soap Saver,"Mine worked as advertised, but as others have said the soap sticks to it *very* well. I've used it as a ""scrub"" to get at my callouses...maybe a future upgrade would feature a puck of pumice on the underside? To keep your soap from sticking, treat a new one of these with a coat of melted beeswax. It brings out the woodgrain, protects the wood further, and your soap will stay put but not stick to it.",4,2016-09-05 04:00:00+00:00,70698419
True,My only soap from here on.,Dr. Squatch Favorites Pack,"Smells clean and manly, not sweet and perfumey like the other soaps that teenagers use. Gives a great clean and rinses easily. Really like the Pine Tar Bar!",5,2016-07-30 04:00:00+00:00,203407568
True,awesome soap!!,Bay Rum,So far this is my favorite soap!! I use this on my beard and can enjoy the wonderful scent all day long. Not to strong but not weak like some girly soap.,5,2015-12-28 04:00:00+00:00,70700670

True,It really works,Soap Saver,"The soap saver really does help the bar last longer. My bay rum and pine tar lasted nearly the full two weeks. Beforehand my soap bars were lasting, maybe a week, if that. I'm really surprised by the negative reviews.",5,2016-05-29 04:00:00+00:00,70698419
True,Best Soap Ever,Gold Moss,It smells great. It feels great. It is great. I highly recommend getting soap from Dr. Squatch.,5,2016-09-26 04:00:00+00:00,70701905

True,Like a moss bed...,Gold Moss,Just imagine yourself laying down in a forest and you don't want to get up because it smells nice. Then this tree moss starts growing on your body but you let it stay because its scent is superb. This is basically what gold moss scrub is like.,5,2016-03-11 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
True,Great stuff,Beechwood Bourbon,"Smells great, and does not leave my skin dried out like other soaps. Bay Rum is a good one!",5,2016-04-15 04:00:00+00:00,70704176
True,Smells delicious,Bay Rum,"This bar has a yummy scent, I almost want to eat it. I just wish it would lather a little more.",4,2015-12-22 04:00:00+00:00,70700670
True,Great soap,Deep Sea Goats Milk,"This is my everyday soap. It's great for dry skin and has a great smell. It's also my gf favorite, so it's a must.",5,2015-12-22 04:00:00+00:00,70699496
True,Don't listen to the haters!!!,Soap Saver,"My soap saver showed up and looks amazing, good quality craftsmanship and the Dr. Squatch logo WAS branded on it. Ignore the negative comments and give this product a fair assessment. Did I mention their soap is awesome!!!",5,2016-10-08 04:00:00+00:00,70698419
True,I'm a lady...,Pine Tar,"...and I love this manly soap. For me! Not my husband/boyfriend/other! The scent is addicting...I find myself lathering up more times than required because I just adore the smell and feel of this soap. It's luxurious to me...AND hardworking. I just glow when I leave the shower! I have used Grandpa's Pine Tar Soap quite often in the past, and if you're accustomed to that scent this one is much subtler...and more complex. Buy. Love. And spread the word!",5,2016-08-26 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,"Good Soap, Great Smell",Pine Tar,"This soap is pretty fantastic. Smells great (nice pine smell but not one of those fake chemically pine but a real forest pine smell), lathers well, has some good texture due to the sand and oatmeal, leaves your skin feeling clean (doesn't leave that soap film feeling to your skin). However it is a dark soap and if you care about your white wash cloth you may want to think about getting a darker cloth (only down side I've seen).",4,2016-09-13 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,I like it... I like it a laawt.,Pine Tar,"The title says it for me. This soap smells like the great outdoors and it's definitely manly. The sand and oatmeal in this bar will ensure that no chigger, tick, or small forest creature will hitch a ride on your man-hide. And the scent? The scent is strong enough for a sasquatch, but made for a man... This pine scent will have the most horrendous battle-a$$ gone in 60 seconds. The lather is just right... There's just enough lather to let you know that it is soap and not some weird square hockey puck. If you tweeze your eyebrows, you probably won't like this soap. My only disappointment is that I didn't find it sooner.",5,2016-02-29 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,One of my favorites; pleasant Sage comes strongly,Nautical Sage,"Clearly scent is evaluated subjectively, but I find Nautical Sage to be very fresh and find the seaside vibe to be fitting. Additionally, this bar is scented strictly with essential oils and no fragrance oils which is another major plus. I cannot understand the current rating, and hope that over time it will increase. When I first tried it I was not sold immediately, yet it has grown on me and now we keep this one by the kitchen sink. It works perfectly there. Clary sage and lavender go very well together; this reminds me of Schmidt's natural deodorant scent Lavender and Sage with a more masculine aroma. I don't smell the cypress too strongly, but I know its in there. Sea salt is always great and contributes to making hands feel more nourished, hence why we like having it near the sink to offset harsh dish ""soaps."" As a reference my other two favorites from Dr. Squatch are Pine Tar and Gold Moss Scrub, lately Cedar Citrus has also grown on me. Also if you have not tried the natural beard oil/cologne",5,2016-03-28 04:00:00+00:00,112874164
True,Love this soap!,Gold Moss,"Just got this on the mail today and OMG! Bought a variety pack and opened this one first. Immediately blown away by the classic rugged smell. After a shower and shave with a nice organic sandlewood soap, I smell like an outdoorsy millionaire. Thank you Dr. Squatch! I'm now a devoted fan. Nate in SA",5,2016-06-03 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
True,A Perfect Soap!,Cologne Samples,"I'm a rookie with this soap and a lifelong consumer of Supermarket soaps, being a stubborn customer that only used brand name soaps and shampoos, I was a little leary. I received my first two bars of Pine tar about a month ago and when I lathered up, it was WONDERFUL! The smell put my mind to the deep forests immediately and the added black lather makes you really feel like a Squatch.",5,2015-12-20 04:00:00+00:00,70705703
True,"Good bar, good scrub",Pine Tar,"My friends and I refer to this one informally as the ""Pine Tar Nipple Eraser"" as they aren't lying when they said it has serious exfoliation qualities. Made with sand and oatmeal flakes, this is a scrubbing bar that smells good, scrubs well, and leaves you with a clean feeling, but you should definitely mind around your softer bits as you can scratch yourself with the bar. I recommend wearing one side down on your hand before using it as a body bar. Also given its color and sand component, it's also the most likely to leave a ring in your bathtub. Not a deal breaker for me, but may be for some.",4,2016-02-25 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,This is my third favorite bar,Bay Rum,"Behind Gold Moss Scrub and Pine Tar, this is in my regular rotation. I like the scent (to me, it's heavy on cloves), it lathers up well, and is a nice contrast to the other bars I regularly use to give my skin a break from exfoliation for a couple weeks (which is about how long the bars last for me).",4,2016-02-25 04:00:00+00:00,70700670
True,My Husband's Cologne Addiction,Cologne Samples,"My husband was really into the Armani and Lacoste colognes when we first met. Admittedly, they smelled great on him. But in the last few years, I've really been getting into replacing our chemical-filled products with healthy alternatives. I was able to change his shampoo and conditioner, his soap, shaving gel and deodorant, but it was hard for him to part with his cologne. Luckily, I found Dr. Squatch and ordered the samples. He really liked both scents, but he picked Driftwood, so I ordered him a full-sized bottle just now. Thanks for making great-smelling cologne. Now how about women's fragrances?",5,2016-06-04 04:00:00+00:00,70705703
True,My go to soap,Pine Tar,"This has become my only soap I will use. I absolutely love the smell of the Pine Tar soap. The other scents are great too. I just keep reordering the Pine Tar as it is my favorite. It is gritty and rough, but I really like that I feel like I can really get clean with it. Usually a bar lasts me about 4 weeks just by keeping it dry in between showers. Keep up the great work Dr. Squatch!",5,2016-07-12 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

True,Black Soap Bomb!,Pine Tar,This was my first squatch soap experience! Awesome product! I use it in conjunction with a luffa. I plan o trying all of the soaps available. My skin feels much better now that I am chemical free!,5,2016-03-14 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Great clean scent!,Cedar Citrus,Another awesome Soap! It smells great! My skin feels awesome and it leaves my bathroom smelling great too!,5,2016-03-14 04:00:00+00:00,70701577
True,I no longer smell like a goat,Deep Sea Goats Milk,"This is one of only a few scents that I have found in any store around here and it was over two hours away. It was one of the first I tried. The goat's milk makes my skin really soft and this soap has a fresh, clean scent. They key to thisvsoap awesomeness is how well it moisturizes. I have dry skin to begin with so the more moisture the better. Also, this bar seemed to be the longest-lasting with the citrus Cedar a close second. I'm happy to get 2 weeks out of my bar and this one lasted three. Great product for sure!",4,2016-07-08 04:00:00+00:00,70699496
True,Love the Pine Tar..,Crushed Pine,"Just started using this stuff a couple months ago but have no complaints. Smells great, lasts for hours. Also love the Evergreen trail cologne. I've never worn cologne but I love this stuff. Always get compliments on how good I smell.",5,2016-05-01 04:00:00+00:00,86211176

True,Aloe is my favorite so far,Cool Fresh Aloe,Only tried the pine tar other than the cool fresh aloe but I like the aloe more. The best way to make you soap last is to use a wash cloth to get the lather then rinse off the bar and keep it in a soap container. Definitely a customer for life,5,2016-02-01 04:00:00+00:00,70699856
True,Best soap I've ever tried!,Pine Tar,"Pine Tar soap is great. It smells amazing (while you're showering) and I use it as a shampoo, face wash, and body soap. At first I was scared the first time I showered with it because I got that squeaky clean feeling but don't mistake that with dryness. Once you dry off you realize how soft this makes your skin. It also smells amazing. I have short hair so Im able to use it as a shampoo as well but Idk how well any bar soap would be for long hair. Can't wait to try the aloe soap once I run out of the pine tar!",5,2016-02-01 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Awesome!!,Bay Rum,The soap lathers like crazy and leaves you feeling clean and refreshed. I use it mostly on my beard and it is always soft and clean after using the soap. The scent is nice. I found it almost comforting and it reminded me of my grandfathers spice closet that i used to love as a kid. Really great especially just before bed.,5,2016-06-23 04:00:00+00:00,70700670
True,I like this one!,Nautical Sage,Don't understand the negative reviews??? It has a very pleasant scent and lathers good! I feel clean and refreshed after showering with this soap. This and Bay Rum are at the top of my list!,4,2016-05-20 04:00:00+00:00,112874164
True,Gets the truck off,Cologne Samples,I work between 40 and 60 hours per week on an automotive assembly line. I come home stinking and with dirt in places I can explain. Dr Squatch Pine Tar soap gets the crud and stench off like nothing I've ever used before. It also has a scent my wife and kids all like and I love. Thanks for the little square miracle. Aryk Sandridge,5,2016-09-01 04:00:00+00:00,70705703
True,Awesome!!!!,Nautical Sage,This is my second bar of Dr. Squatch Soap the first being Pine Tar they are totally different from each other. They are described perfectly the Nautical Sage is a zesty fresh soap that awakens all senses more of a going out for the evening soap. While the Pine Tar is a bold rock your face off tear solid steel beams apart with your teeth apart. I am starting to see you can't go wrong with anything Dr. Squatch makes. My girlfriend loves the way I smell as she is the one who keeps buying them we are going to try all nine!!,5,2016-06-10 04:00:00+00:00,112874164
True,Hands down the best soap ever!!!,Pine Tar,Thank you DR.SQUATCH for making a real soap for a real man and my girlfriend loves the Pine Tar sent! It lavers up great in the shower and gives me that all over clean feeling. Despite the other reviews my Pine Tar has lasted going on two weeks thank you DR.SQUATCH I will never switch back!,5,2016-05-17 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,"I smell like a champ, but not like a sweaty, smelly one...",Dr. Squatch Favorites Pack,"Gold moss soap is epic. I leave the shower a champion, like a 26 miler, like I just pulled off a hat trick. That's what champs do, they execute beyond their victory: and then they bathe. And they bathe to smell like a champion, not a defeated no-account non-winner (loser). I'm a champ, and now I smell like one. I'm leaving my desk now to go home and shower with Gold Moss and re-establish my champ status. Each day is a victory when you act like a champ, and a greater victory when you smell like one. Carry on.",5,2016-02-10 04:00:00+00:00,203407568
True,TIMBER HO,Pine Tar,"""Holy @#$*"" she exclaimed, overwhelmed by the sweeping aroma of a pine forest through our apartment. Yes, this soap isn't your standard pump of mysteriously scented gel. This soap hits like a Tyson uppercut to your pores. It then proceeds to jab its way through the rest of the odors in your bathroom, followed by the rest of your domicile. Work in a fish market and bring that scent home with you? Not anymore. If you want to scrub any scent off your body and stimulate your olfactory senses like a fresh baked loaf of sourdough bread, look no further. (The only negative to this soap is how short it lasts because you'll want to bathe in its glory so often.)",5,2016-03-31 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Great smelling soap.,Cedar Citrus,Definitely one of my favorite scented soaps. Will be keep buying this one on a regular basis.,4,2016-02-26 04:00:00+00:00,70701577
True,Not the best,Bay Rum,"Out of their options, this scent isn't the best they offer. It reminded me too much of an old man and not of a 'bay' or 'harbor'. I'll stick to Nautical Sage for that. I'm 24 and my night life game is strong. I don't need to be smelling like an old man. It's not a 'bad' scent, just not the best in my opinion. However, the soap itself does wonders on my skin and makes me soft. For that, I'll keep using this bar until it's all gone.",4,2016-05-31 04:00:00+00:00,70700670
True,Grab a towel and some sun screen. This will take you to paradise!,Nautical Sage,I'm not entirely sure why this soap is getting bad reviews. I received mine and I'm loving it. It is very nautical and crisp smelling. I'm always at the beach and this is perfect. Good lather and gentle on my skin. Scent stays with me as well for about an hour or so after showering. I'll definitely keep buying Nautical Sage.,5,2016-05-31 04:00:00+00:00,112874164
True,Packed with Manly Smelling Goodness,Gold Moss,Got this bar in the mail yesterday and immediately jumped in the shower to lather up. I have a big beard and the natural ingredients made me feel safe that I wouldn't be stripping away any natural oils. It left my skin soft and smelling great as well. I will be buying more scents and bars to try in the future,5,2016-07-20 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
True,Feel like a million bucks!,Dr. Squatch Favorites Pack,"Best soap I have ever used! Waited with baited breath for it to arrive in the mail. Got it today and tried it. The aroma was so great when I opened the package, I had to shower right away to give a try. It exfoliated, moisturized, and made my skin feel great. Was a wonderful experience! My fiance even hung out in the bathroom to smell it while I was showering. Then she attacked me after I got out!",5,2016-05-21 04:00:00+00:00,203407568
True,i just love this soap and the beard oil,Dr. Squatch Favorites Pack,"Gotta admit i am partial to the pine tar soap and hemlock trail beard oil but i love these products, i get excited each time i see a new product coming down the line, can't wait for deodorant and shampoo to come out....keep on squatchin....",5,2015-12-20 04:00:00+00:00,203407568

True,Love the Squatch,Dr. Squatch Soap Co.,I found Dr Squatch thru the Bearded Bastard & I've been a customer since. Squatch soap has become the standard by which all other soaps are judged. Showers are like a beautiful dream. Thank you for waking me up from a body wash nightmare.,5,2016-11-11 04:00:00+00:00,yotpo_site_reviews
True,"Great, but not the best for $7.00",Pine Tar,"This soap was great; it smelled great, cleaned great, and I felt great after using it. However, it only lasted a week. I have a soap dish in my shower that I put it on, obviously, when I am not using it. I guess you're supposed to let it dry out? I'm not going to consistently use expensive soap that I need to dry out after every shower. But again, this soap was great quality and maybe I just got a bad bar.",3,2016-11-15 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,Brand,Soap Saver,"My soap saver came without the ""Dr Squatch"" branding",3,2016-11-15 04:00:00+00:00,70698419
True,Great Aftershave!!,Beechwood Bourbon,"This is a nice aftershave I like to use! Sometimes I will use it at night as a beard oil as well. It really helps moisturize your beard especially when your trying to grow it out. The scent is a bit woodsy (which I don't care for too much) but no where near as strong as Hemlock trail. If your looking for a cleaner/lighter version then this is the way to go. I would wear this during the daytime and the hemlock at night as the hemlock scent is better to have around the house when you winding down or trying to impress the lady haha! 

This cologne has more of a citrus hint to it so for daytime use its a win. Great oil that lasts a long time. Thank you Squatch Nation! #Squatchaddict",4,2016-11-16 04:00:00+00:00,70704176
True,I feel like I'm using actual soap for the first time in my life.,Pine Tar,"A truly wonderful product. I hope Dr. Squatch continues to grow without compromising this soap because it is a game-changer for me. I've always suffered from acne concentrated solely on my chest. Rarely on the face or back, but my chest would always break out no matter what I did. Well I've used the Pine Tar soap bar for 9 days. I don't have any new blemishes, and the ones I had are all slowly becoming smaller, less red, and less irritated. A couple are completely gone.

The soap itself is a pleasure to use. The oatmeal feels like you're getting a massage. The scent is fantastic. I admittedly love a powerful sent, and this one delivers. As others have said, if you leave the bar in your bathroom, the whole room will take on a lasting scent of pine. I've never struggled with dry skin so there wasn't much to improve on here, but I do feel very clean and smooth after using it. 

I did not notice a black film forming on the shower like others have said. Typical soaps that aren't plain white always left a little something, and this went down the drain just like those did.

The bar only last 9 washes for me, but it's important to note that it was my first time ever using it, so for many of these showers I continued to lather up out of pleasure, not necessity. I'm sure once the novelty of the soap wears off, I'll be using it more economically, and I would assume 2 weeks + is very achievable. 

Gold Moss is up next. Thank you for this product. It's invigorating my day every time I use it. I am a natural skeptic, and generally speaking, I tend to poo-poo people who gravitate towards all-natural/organic/vegan products (though using products that don't come from Palm Oil is very, very important to me). I'm not a fan of ""pseudo-sciences"" for lack of a better term. I often feel that if something was truly bad for you, in this age, the information would be out there. But in this case I don't feel my typical thinking applies. It just seems logical to me. Why not use a product that harnesses glycerin instead of replacing it with chemicals? Why not use a product that smells better? Why not use a product that feels better?

The easing of chest acne may be a coincidence. It's come and gone before. I'll know more about that in a month or so because I won't be using anything else (though the signs as of now are promising). The rest I already know. This is the best soap I've ever used.",5,2016-11-17 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Good Soap,Spearmint Basil,"Spearmint basil soap is an alright soap. I like how it has a really powerful minty scent to it but it reminds of me washing my body with toothpaste. The lather is thick and the soap itself on my skin feels very good. I like to use the soap especially in the morning when I'm waking up as the scent is very refreshing. I didn't get any scent of basil in mine so I'm not sure if I got a bad bar or batch. Overall...soap does its trick but not something I really enjoyed compared to other soap bars. In short...it lathers good, its very refreshing, leaves a great scent in my bathroom, and it cleans me up real nice.",3,2016-11-18 04:00:00+00:00,70701388
True,A very unique fragrance I think most men will enjoy.,Crushed Pine,"I'm giving this cologne 5 stars, though I think 4.5 would be more appropriate. Let me start by saying, like Dr. Squatch's soaps, you are in for a very unique experience with Hemlock Trail. As clearly stated, there is only 1 oz of cologne for $42 dollars. That translates to a whopping $143 dollars if you were to average it out to your standard 3.4oz bottle of cologne. That is very, very pricey, gentlemen. I support paying for quality, but it'd be great if we can get that price point down by about 25%. Hopefully that's in the cards as Dr. Squatch continues to grow.

Having said all this, the design of the bottle is FANTASTIC. Aesthetically, it just looks awesome on your shelf. Rugged and old school, and inspires confidence after applying it (which is 1/2 the battle with any cologne!). Additionally, I won't pretend to know the actual engineering here, but there is a some sort of stopper mechanism, so when you are adding a drop to your fingers, you'd have to actually continue dabbing over and over in order to use an excessive amount. With other colognes a couple spritzes can be quite a lot, and then other bottles don't have any kind've stopper on top. But this cologne inspires you to use in moderation, and that will certainly extend the life of the bottle.

Now to the scent... it is wonderful. When taking a whiff directly from the bottle, for me, it came off a little too much like they just extracted pine straight from a Christmas tree and dumped it into the bottle. I started to wonder if this was the right product for me. But fear not! When applying moderate dabs to your pulse points and beard, it really does take on a different, more subtle (yet certainly pronounced and unique) scent that absolutely delivers. The strong Christmasy scent in the bottle somehow begins to embody the earthy and all-natural musk I think most people will be looking for with this product. To be fair, I think part of my initial... skepticism... is that the scent is so interesting and unlike anything you can get in a department store that I almost didn't quite know how to react.

Bottom line... my girlfriend who rarely is a fan of my choices in this department loved the scent. The best way I can describe it, as mentioned earlier, is subtle but pronounced. It has an impact without taking over the room. It also comes off differently at different times for me. I'll smell my pulse point and it'll smell woodsy, and then 10 minutes later if I do it again, and that citrus will make an appearance. That's really cool.

Pros: Unique, enjoyable scent in a wonderful bottle design.
Cons: Pricey, and a bit of an acquired taste for those used to more typical colognes. But that taste will certainly be acquired.

Bottom line: I absolutely recommend it. There is room for improvement with the price, and maybe (emphasis on maybe) there's something that can be done to appease people who don't want to deviate too far from typical scents... but I wouldn't go there. I love it as is! Driftwood is up next.",5,2016-11-23 04:00:00+00:00,86211176

But, if you mean that it saves your soap for the next time you use it, then I have some issues - every single time I've try to take the bar off the ""soap saver,"" I have to literally pry it off, and always lose pieces of soap in the process.

True,great soap,Pine Tar,"I work in a grease manufacturing facility. On a daily basis I can get oil, grease, solvents, additives, or solids (graphite, etc..) on my skin.

Now I just use pine tar and don't need to scrub my skin off or use lotion. Not sure if there is a natural degreaser in the soap but it sure feels like it.",5,2016-11-26 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

True,Bay Rum is the best,Bay Rum,I love this bay rum soap. It's a fantastic scent that leaves you feeling clean enough to make an entire galley walk the plank. I got quite a few soaps with my soapscription and can say this is the best one.,5,2016-12-02 04:00:00+00:00,70700670
True,"As always, an excellent bar",Nautical Sage,Just started using this one for the first time. It's a lather beast. Great as a beard wash too. It has a less noticeable scent than most of the other bars so if you're looking for low-key in that department this is one to try.,5,2016-12-02 04:00:00+00:00,112874164
True,First impressions on the travel bag,Travel Bag,"This arrived today. I will be trying it out with a wet bar before I commit to using this on a trip. First, it's a good size. Bar fits fine in the bag. Not too big, not too small. Side seams look sturdy. Next, the drawstrings are a concern. They are essentially very thin twine. I have visions of those breaking in short order, particularly if I or someone else tries to tighten/over-tighten the bag opening. Shouldn't be difficult to replace if they do break, but why not settle for something more durable to begin with, ideally with some sort of slider to keep the strings taut. Thirdly, I have concerns about the absorption qualities. I would feel better if they had doubled up on the material, but right now, it's essentially one layer of canvas, with a loose weave (while you can't see through it, light passes through it with zero problem). Got a bar damp and put it in the bag. Several minutes later, while the bag itself does not appear to be wet, you can feel a very slight dampness through the material. So not quite waterproof as I had hoped, but I'll give it a whirl.",3,2016-12-06 04:00:00+00:00,543921815
True,This shit is awesome.,Pine Tar,"I just took my first shower with this bar soap, and it was so good that I had to come and talk about it right away. The texture was nice, scent was nice, feel very clean and not dried out after. Buy it, you won't regret it.",5,2016-12-06 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Fantastic Stuff.,Gold Moss,"I got a bar of this in a Bespoke Post box a couple months ago, and it was game-changing. It smells like the most attractive, manly forest floor you've ever seen in your life. I've been showering daily with it for two months, and it's finally almost gone. I can't fathom how some people are only getting 1-3 weeks out of a bar of soap?

This was the soap that made me get a Dr. Squatch subscription. It's phenomenal.",5,2016-12-12 04:00:00+00:00,70701905

True,Superb!,Nautical Sage,"Out of their nine scents, I'm surprised this one isn't more popular... While using it, I smell the sage along with a sea saltiness, resulting in the scent of an ocean breeze, but even better! 

If you're already a squatcher and considering the nautical sage bar, don't hesitate! In my opinion, it holds up with the top selling scents! 

If you're new to the sport of squatching, you better start working on trying all nine scents. So far I've tried 4/9, all which have been nothing short of superb!",5,2016-12-17 04:00:00+00:00,112874164
True,So Fresh & So Clean!,Hair Care Kit,"Just received the Shampoo and Conditioner and had my first showering experience with them. Right off the bat both products smell terrific! Just the right amount of manly scent you would expect from Dr. Squatch! Using the recommended nickel sized amount I lathered up with the shampoo. Due to the all natural ingredients you won't be getting a massive lather worked up like you would get with commercial shampoos. No worries though, because that nickel sized amount got my hair the cleanest I've felt it in along time! I followed up with the conditioner next. Using the same amount I applied and let it sit for a few minutes. WOW! The fresh tingle I got felt like no other. You can feel this cooling yet moisturizing sensation invigorate your scalp! It left my hair very manageable and fresh. Dr Squatch has a real winner here! ( Please come up with a deodorant next!)",5,2016-12-19 04:00:00+00:00,503651566

False,"Love the soap, unfortunately a poor value",Pine Tar,I love the scent of the soap as well as the exfoliation and the way it makes my skin feel. But this soap is not worth the money.

True,Awesome after a dirty day,Pine Tar,"One of my top 3 favorites. Smells exactly how you'd expect (basically a pine tree)
Lather: 3.5/5 - I'm guessing the additives like sand and the pine chips make it lather a little less than the other soaps
Smell: 4.5/5 - Smells fantastic, but not the best of them all
Exfoliation: 5/5 - The sand REALLY does its job 
Overall: 4.5/5 - I'd use this soap after a long, sweaty day, or if I'm covered in dirt",5,2016-12-24 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

True,Shampoo,Shampoo,This is the first time I have ever used an all natural hair care product. Really just getting used to how it lathers up and makes my hair feel afterwards. The smell of it isn't super great or anything but it's definitely not an offensive smell at all. Still happy that I made the switch to the Dr Squatch brand.

False,Not my favorite Dr. Squatch product,Pine Tar,"The smell was okay (in my opinion), but my girlfriend hated it and no longer wanted to shower with me because she ""didn't want to smell like a roofer"". The scrub in it left scratches all over my skin because the pieces of whatever it was would stick out a half centimeter and I would have to manually break them off the bar. That being said, my skin was soft after using it. I won't be buying it again though.",3,2016-12-26 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,Turned my skin to scales,Bay Rum,"Admittedly, I have sensitive skin, that's why I like homemade soaps. And I love the smell of this soap. Unfortunately the skin on my face reacted in the most heinous way to this soap. Bumps all over and I feel like I have a sunburn.

I will say, it has a very pleasant scent but it tends to dissolve pretty quickly and I can't see it lasting for more than a week or so. Pretty pricey for 1 bar of soap. Maybe it's because we both take super hot showers but regardless. It also leaves the shower super slippery, pretty much requiring to clean it after every use.

True,Does what it's supposed to do.,Soap Saver,"Saves your soap, no nonsense. I have had it for a year so far and I guess you can say it's ptetty durable to be a light piece of cedarwood. Gives your soap a light complementary woodsy smell after each use. Only problem I would point out is that the soap sometimes will stick to it but a quick solution instead of tearing your bar apart to get it off is to lightly wet it under the showerhead and then pull off gently.",4,2016-12-31 04:00:00+00:00,70698419
False,NOT as pictured,Soap Saver,"This was my very first buy from Dr. Squatch and I must say. Not happy. Soap? - Yes... Happy. Soap Saver? No... not at all. The ""Picture"" on the website makes it look like this really cool wood block with rounded edges, and the wider face/ridge in the middle with the logo burned in.. what I got looks like it was made out of a piece of wood scrap, all the edges are sharp, not at all like what they have pictured on the website. I wasn't expecting a wooden sculpture, but come on... at least send me the product on the website, not something your cousin Jeff banged out in 18 seconds after he was done trimming a door frame.

True,WOW!!!,Pine Tar,"holy fucking shit!!! i was not expecting this, i bought this soap on the whim of a facebook ad, which was perhaps the best thing i could have done. This soap is amazing, its hard to convey how good and masculine this stuff smells and the cleanliness one feels after you shower, just buy it! now! Prior to Dr.Squatch, i used dove's body wash for men and after just one shower, i took all my dove stuff and put them where they belong; in the trash. You have a life long customer right here, my skin thanks you and the women who squeeze me that much harder thanks you as well.",5,2017-01-01 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,"Great for long hair, if you use it correctly",Hair Care Kit,"I've grown quite of fond of Dr Squatch's products, their soaps are awesome and I expected the same from their Hair Care kit. I'm happy to say the kit is every bit as good as their other stuff, but it comes with a disclaimer.

If you have long hair, do not use conditioner everyday as advertised. Doing so will cause your oils to latch onto your hair like glue, and instead of your hair looking and feeling healthy, it'll look dull, and feel very greasy. You only want to condition the same day you wash, which brings me to another point. Washing your hair every 3-4 days is ideal as you will have to use a bit more than what they recommend in order to give your hair a good clean. This stuff does the job well but working it into a lather is a little more effort than with other shampoos. I recently got a shampoo pump with mine, and I use 1 squeeze of the pump for my top, sides, and back of my scalp, so 4 in total that I use to work into a nice lather. It cleans very well, and doesn't leave your hair damaged or brittle, allowing the oils to come in and give it a fantastic feel and look. 

Aside from that, my only other complaint is the scents, I can not wait to have the shampoo in cool citrus as well, or something that compliments their pine tar soap. 

Those are really my only critiques with this stuff, it's basically everything I wanted, and I will continue to keep using Dr Squatch so long as I possibly can, as far as I'm concerned nothing comes close.",4,2017-01-03 04:00:00+00:00,503651566

False,Conditioner,Conditioner,"The conditioner is nothing special. It left my hair chalky feeling.

True,Great For Face,Pine Tar,"AWESOME for your face!! I'm 25 and have suffered from Acne periodically since I was a teen. not only is this a great body cleanser, but Ive started using it on my face as well and my breakouts are significantly better. and it surprisingly tones (no more redness) great smell too. if only they had the same scent in a face lotion!

True,You'll be yodeling in the shower,Hair Care Kit,"I've been using this great shampoo and conditioner for a couple of weeks, after getting my package from the kickstarter campaign. Since using, my hair is super easy to manage, and I use far less hair product for styling. I also suffer from dry scalp due to hard water and living in a dry, mountain environment. Since using this product, I haven't yet felt the need to grab a dry scalp shampoo or scalp damaging dandruff shampoo. The smell is amazing, and the price is just right.

True,SMELLS SO GOOD!,Bay Rum,"Used it for the first time two days ago. Took a shower at 0630 and when I came home at 2000 my girlfriend commented on how good I smelled still. The smell is amazing and will last all day. The Bay Rum is a clean spicy smell, that will linger just enough where you get a ""wiff"" every now and then; reminding you as to how a man should smell. If you want a little jazz in you soap, and are sick of smelling like a high school kid from 2004; try it. Kick the store bought garbage, and try something that you can actually feel good about using!

True,A life saver,Soap Saver,After using the soap and realized they weren't going to last in my shower I decided to give this a go. The soap does stick to the soap saver and dries the bar out quicker I've never had an issue getting the bar off the soap saver. If it ever gets stuck I just run the soap and soap saver over the water and it frees up right away. So far I love the soap and the soap saver so let's see what the shampoo and conditioner does! I'm hoping there will be a face wash soon with the Pine Tar scent.,5,2017-01-16 04:00:00+00:00,70698419
False,Great Scent,Cedar Citrus,"I love the scent. It is me to a tee because I love cedar and citrus. The issue I have with it is the scent is too light. You just don't really smell it lathering up unless you smell the bar. I wish it were stronger like Pine Tar, otherwise it would be my favorite. There is no scrub in this soap so it is slippery compared you pine tar. It is still a great non drying soap, but it is hard to beat pine tar.",3,2017-01-17 04:00:00+00:00,70701577
True,The king of soaps,Pine Tar,"There is nothing like this soap. It's completely addicting. It is strong smelling and very scrubby. It smells ""of"" pine, but nowhere like pine sol cleaner. It is worth the money because it is unique and delivers as a quality non drying soap. I don't think I can live without it anymore.",5,2017-01-17 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,Not bad. Skin feels nice,Bay Rum,"I wasnt sure what to expect from this brand of soap being a new customer and all but decided to give it a shot. The scents take some getting used too, but they grow on you and make your skin feel great. Only issue i can find is that the scent doesn't stay on your skin long after showering. Going to eventually try all the others.",3,2017-01-17 04:00:00+00:00,70700670
True,Pine Tar is great!,Pine Tar,I really love the soap and it smells awesome! The only problem is it didn't last long enough. Maybe I took too many showers because I enjoyed the scent so much.,4,2017-01-18 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Superior clean,Shampoo,"Not sure I'd call the scent ""Uplifting Ocean Breeze"" or ""Cypress Coast"" as the description says. It's more of a ""this smells like it's gettin' my hair really clean"" kinda smell. And it sure does. I've never used a shampoo that makes my hair feel this clean. I find I have to use just a bit more than a dime sized amount, but this shampoo is fantastic.
BTW...the conditioner doesn't suck either.",5,2017-01-18 04:00:00+00:00,83122902
False,Disappointed,Pine Tar,I really wanted to like this product and was really excited when I got it in the mail. I opened the box and theover whelming stench of pine-sol cleaner invaded my nostrils. I decided to seperate the bars and let them air out a little. Nope. No change. I took a shower with the soap. And ehh it was ok. Left me smelling like I had been rolling in the before mentioned cleaning supplies. As I said in the title. I'm very disappointed. I've been using grandpa pine tar soap for years. And that leaves you feeling good after a shower. And smelling manly. Like you've been strolling through a forest with a fire going. Guess I'll be switching back,1,2017-01-18 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,I gave Dr. Squatch a try 2 weeks ago...,Gold Moss,"I gave Dr. Squatch a try after seeing an advertisement online, and decided to look into it. For years, I have used all types of men's body wash. Most all of the top brands you'd find in most stores, I have them a shot. With the body washes marketed towards men with scents like ""Desire"" ""Manly Man"" ""RattleBear"" ""Glacier"" ""Nighthawk"" ""Dragon Tamer"" you name it, I probably gave it a shot. I read how Dr. Squatch used natural ingredients, and handmade soap, and I have to admit, it caused me to think about what was in all these wild and crazy body washes I'd grown accustomed to. A lot of these body washes had ridiculously strong scents, which I wasn't a fan of. It felt like I was doused in cologne as I showered.

Then, Dr. Squatch arrived. I'll admit, I was a bit weary of bar soaps. I had been scarred into thinking that all bar soaps left my skin feeling like there was residue that left my skin feeling very dry. I gave the ole Sqautch a try, and here it what I loved about it. First, was the lather. This soap really lathered well whether it be scrubbed in my bare skin, or used with a washcloth. The scent was just right, it wasn't too strong, nor to weak. It was the perfect amount for me. The soap washes off easily, and after drying off, I never got the feeling of a residue on my hand. I really like this soap, it just fits my personality and preferences.

Gold Moss is an absolute incredible scent. I really don't know how to describe it. It's a perfect masculine scent that appeals to the men, and the ladies dig it. It's got earthy undertones, with a hint of spice. It smells warm, sophisticated, and what a mature lad should smell like. 

Give it a try, I don't think I'll be going back to men's body washes.",5,2017-01-19 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
True,Spearmint Basil Scrub = Great stuff!,Spearmint Basil,"Got this particular scent in my first SoapScription box, and I really like this soap. First off, Dr. Squatch will now be replacing all of the previous men's body washes that I have been using. Other brands that claim they know how a man should smell just doesn't quite cut it. I don't want to smell like I just bathed in cologne when I get out of the shower. Dr. Squatch Spearmint Basil scrub smells fantastic. It has a clean and minty scent, with various spices in the undertone. It's not overbearing, nor is it underwhelming. For me, it's just right. I feel energized as I scrub and smell fantastic once I dry off that stays with me for the day.

Give it a shot.",5,2017-01-19 04:00:00+00:00,70701388

False,"Great soap, shipping needs work",Gold Moss,"I've ordered twice and I especially loved the way the Gold Moss Scrub smells. I wasn't wild about Bay Rum, it kind of reminded me of those cinnamon candles. Scent aside, I have very sensitive skin and most store-bought soaps leave me with an itchy rash but Dr. Squatch does not. I just wished they would ship orders a lot faster. Both times were slow, but this time it took them a week just to ship my order and will take another 4 days to get here from what is only about a 4-hour drive. Seriously guys, most businesses are able to ship orders within a day or 2, a week just makes me think you guys are being lazy.",4,2017-01-26 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
False,You should probably buy a different one.,Soap Saver,"The soap saver looks cool and is the perfect size for the soap, but the soap sticks extremely badly. I expect the amount of soap saved by using this is at least cancelled out by the chunks that get pulled off every time you take a shower. There are lots of these on the market, and you would probably be better off buying one of them at a significant fraction of this price.",2,2017-01-26 04:00:00+00:00,70698419

True,Smells Amazing and Feels Amazing,Pine Tar,"Tested this out for the first time after using a Body Wash product for a while. The difference was so substantial on multiple levels. The shower was more invigorating and woke me up more than using the drab body wash. I know I smelled awesome. My skin feels like it was moisturized instead of being dried out. 

As a bearded dude, I lathered this up in my beard instead of using shampoo and I noticed a difference in quality there too. My beard felt treated and has helped my beard oil treatment in preventing any beardruff.

Highly recommended from me.",5,2017-02-01 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

True,Impressive,Cool Fresh Aloe,"Decided to give Squatch a try. Had a conflict with my order due to ordering on a mobile device and having a conflict with the web site. My order got a little messed up but the CS was great and made it right promptly. I switched from a brand that their soap was a considerable amount lager bar soap. Decided to give these guys a try and am very happy I did. 

The production of suds is crazy! Even though these bars are smaller, I am willing to bet that it produces more than the larger bar competitor. Along with that, my skin is the softest it's been since I can remember and do not need lotion like I used to. 

For longevity, I get wet and turn my shower head to water save, sud up, and place the bar on edge out of the way of splashing water so it will dry out nicely. 

Glad I made the switch!",5,2017-02-15 04:00:00+00:00,70699856

With this stuff i washed my skin, my face, and my short hair. No hint of dry skin! WHAT IS THIS SORCERY!? Dr. Squatch you hit the nail on the head with this stuff. I will definitely be a return customer. My skin and hair seriously feel amazing thank you so much. Completely worth the price even though they are smaller bars. I might report back with how long it lasts me, and if i see a significant reduction in acne scars on my face or anything positive!

True,Frustrated No More,Dr. Squatch Favorites Pack,For years I have been frustrated with the pathetic assortment of soap suitable for men. Most have made my skin itch and/or dry.

True,"Sit Down Son, About to Make you a Man",Pine Tar,"Pine Tar is absolutely the best scent. I have tried the entire line and I keep coming back to Pine Tar! So, why the title? Well, that is for anyone who would give this lower than a 3 star.

Complaint 1) Dont like the pine smell? I do enjoy intellectually stimulating conversations involving differing opinions. The pine tar soap has a very successful aroma therapeutic effect. Something along the lines of tearing a pine tree out of the ground with your bare hands and rubbing that conifer all over your body. 

Complaint 2) Doesn't last long? This is most likely not the fault of the product. You most likely are putting your bar into the line of fire of your faucet. Water + Soap = Conversion to Suds = Soap Dissolving. OR perhaps you are placing it onto a flat/solid surface with no ventilation to allow the soap to dry which leaves your poor soap to soak in a puddle of water. I refer to the equation again. OR you are holding the soap in your hand and lathering your body directly for the entirety of your shower. Equation still applies. I recommend using a lathering apparatus such as a loofah. Don't worry, the soap more than makes up for the unmanly loofah, besides your soap will last a month and being practical and wise is manly. Do keep the equation in mind. It will help you be wise with your investment.

Complaint 3) Do not like the black scum? Well, the bar is black, it produces black scum. All soap produces a viscous matter you refer to as soap scum. So this is not unique to the pine tar soap; only the black color. This should not be held against the product. It should be met with understanding and acceptance. 

Thank you, Dr Squatch, for a fantastic bar soap.",5,2017-03-01 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,"Smells fine, but turns things black.",Pine Tar,"Aside from the fact that I had to clean my shower all of the time while using this bar of soap, it itself was awesome. Smell was great, the sand was a nice touch for exfoliation. However, I could literally see where the soap had run down the side of my shower where I keep the bar when not in use.",4,2017-03-02 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

True,"Um, the best soap EVER!",Gold Moss,"This is my favorite scent, I like it more than anything I've ever tried, from stores or internet. Has a nice masculine scent that isn't overpowering. My wife also loves it, she won't stop smelling me after I've showered with it. LOL Doesn't dry my skin out, and leaves my skin feeling soft. Highly recommend this soap!",5,2017-03-02 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
False,Didn't like it! Dries out hair even with conditioner!,Shampoo,"This shampoo has a lot of what it feels like acidic components (I want to say its heavy on the citrus ingredients) that cause my hair to get a slight burning feeling and also strip everything off the hair itself. It dries it out really bad and it also makes it just not feel right. I used this for around a month before I made my review and I have to say Yes....it will clean your hair but it will strip off any oils you have. Now if you have oily hair or you just finished that grimy job at work I think this will work out ok. But if your in a cold, dry area like WA state then its a recipe for disaster. I only used it 1-2x a week as well. I always used the conditioner right after to get it to feel better but even as a combo it feels very ""rubbery"". Hard to explain but its like you cleaned the plastic tupperware bin from your sink with a strong soap and get that squeaky clean feel to it when you run your hands across it. Very rubbery and tough. Overall this shampoo is VERY strong and I would say maybe cut it to 1 time every 2 weeks. It does what it states but it also isn't very soothing or pleasing to use. I wish the shampoo cleaned my hair without being so rough or so drying to the point it makes my hair brittle. If this was a bit less harsh then I would enjoy it more. Save your money and buy the bar soap. Rub bar soap in on your head, rinse, and then add conditioner with it. Same job as this shampoo but less expensive, more gentle on your hair, and less bottles to travel with.",2,2017-03-07 04:00:00+00:00,83122902
True,Best Conditioner!,Conditioner,"WOW! I love this conditioner! The way it makes your hair feel after your done using it is awesome. It moisturizes it very well to the point that even when I'm done drying off with a towel, my hair still feels very slick and slightly wet. Doesn't have a greasy feel or anything it just feels like really nice hair. I also noticed my hair color change just a bit. I have black hair and when I started using this (been using it for 1 month), my hair changed to a really dark brown. I also didnt get that much of any tingling sensation like others say in their reviews. I do get a slight cooling feel to it which is nice. 

 The consistency is also really good. I put it in a dispenser so whenever I need it, its easy for me to portion control it. A little goes a long way! It feels like its not real thick when it gets in your hair but don't let that fool you. Its a very milky consistency comparable to hand lotion so when using this in a pump setup, you shouldn't experience any clogging. Overall great product that with the size bottle these guys sell, you can rest assured this bottle will go a LONG way. Don't let the price deter you from purchasing it. I have used this every day (2x a day) for a month and I probably have gone through a bit over 1/4 of a bottle. One tip....dont buy the shampoo! Just use your hand soap and this product. Shampoo isn't the best (really dries your hair out) but using this with the bar soap is a perfect combo! 

Thank you Dr Squatch team for another great product!",5,2017-03-09 04:00:00+00:00,83122952
True,Incredible!,Bay Rum,"I work as a land surveyor, and after days of trekking through the Georgia heat that turns on about noon this time of year, I get off work pretty ripe.

False,Just not quite enough,Shave Bar,Let me start by saying I'm head over heels for the bar soaps. The shave soap has a great smell and lathers very thick. However the suds disappear before I can even lather my entire face. I've tried straight from the can and mixing it with water and brush in a mug. If they could make the lather last longer I'd switch from my shave soap I've used for over a decade.,3,2017-03-18 04:00:00+00:00,98582817
True,Life changing,Bay Rum,Ok maybe not that good but it's amazing. Bay Rum has been my favorite scent out of the 5 scents I've tried. It leaves my normally dry skin moisturized.

False,5th Grade Wood Shop,Soap Saver,"Not impressed with this grade school quality soap saver. Seems cheap, the stain comes off the saver and onto your soap (so you're pretty much washing your body with great soap + lacquer), and is way over priced. They should be giving these away for free.",1,2017-03-26 04:00:00+00:00,70698419
False,Musty Hipster scent,Pine Tar,"I had high hopes for the Pine Tar. The exfoliating is nice, but the scent is overpowering, maybe a little to squatchy. My wife would not get near me for two weeks. If you want to smell like a musty Portland Hipster (I know as I was born and raised there), then this is the scent for you. Not manly, just musty.",1,2017-03-26 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,Soap sticker,Soap Saver,"This should be renamed the soap sticker. Yes, it does keep you soap dry thus extending the life, but the soap sticks the the wood block. Every time you take it off, it will leave little chunks of soap behind. I even soaked it in vegetable oil but it still did not help. Two stars because it smells good.",2,2017-03-26 04:00:00+00:00,70698419

True,"Just try it, and you'll see.",Hair Care Kit,"I decided to try this after reading about all the nasty chemicals in most big-box store brands, figured that might have something to do with feeling like my hair was dry, brittle, and frazzled. I've had a lot of the Dr. Squatch soaps that are good, but the hair care kit is by far my favorite Dr. Squatch product to date.

The Dr. Squatch shampoo smells amazing and lathers well, hair feels clean and I feel more confident about not rubbing gnarly chemicals on my head every day. The conditioner also smells great, and after leaving it in for a couple minutes as directed, hair feels smooth and soft. After a few weeks of use, I definitely felt like my hair had a little more life and resilience compared to feeling beaten down and scorched by the old stuff.

I bought a second hair care kit within a couple weeks because I liked it so much and figured I should just get more to have on hand when I run out. Highly recommended.",5,2017-03-28 04:00:00+00:00,503651566
False,"C'mon, really?",Soap Saver,"First, the soap saver is machine made, not handmade. Second, it's a ripoff priced at $12.00. I could manufacture and sell these for $5.00 and still make at least 100% profit. Don't waste your money. Save it for the soap.",1,2017-03-30 04:00:00+00:00,70698419

False,"Great soap, but....",Pine Tar,"Great soap, love the scents and smells. But soaps are way too small and do not last long.

I gave them 4 stars because they do offer a great product and their customer service is awesome!",4,2017-04-01 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Fantastic!!!,Cool Fresh Aloe,I've never really noticed a difference until I tried this product. After 2 showers I feel and smell a huge difference! I feel like there should be a commercial similar to the snickers commercial.... you're a Sasquatch when you're dirty lol. I'll be a repeat customer.,5,2017-04-02 04:00:00+00:00,70699856
True,Amazing scent and feel!,Gold Moss,Product as advertised! I love it the scent. My skins smells and feels great! Oak moss has taken over as my favorite earthy scent. It used to be patchouli and dragons blood. I highly recommend. Very unique.,5,2017-04-04 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
True,Something Nostalgic About It,Gold Moss,"Not quite sure what it is, but something about this scent reminds me of my childhood. Only thing that would improve this bar for me would be added exfoliation",4,2017-04-06 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
False,I Really Want To Love It,Pine Tar,"The scent is awesome! Its truly a manly scent and has great feel to it. My issue with the bar is that the exfoliation is way too strong. Between the sand and oatmeal, it's like scraping 300 grit sandpaper down your body if you use the bar directly on your skin. Using it with a wash cloth would be fine, but I just can't do it my normal way of bar to skin. Otherwise, its a great soap!",3,2017-04-09 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

False,Love their products,Hair Care Kit,"I love all of the body soaps from these guys and was really excited to try the shampoo and conditioner. It says for all hair types, I myself have pretty thin hair. These product made my hair really greasy feeling and looking. They also gave me pimples on my head front how greasy my hair was! I bet they work wonders on people with thick hair. I love the fact that it's all natural and smells really good!",1,2017-04-15 04:00:00+00:00,503651566
True,manly to the max,Hair Care Kit,"First, let me say, Dr. Squatch is amazing. so far I have tired the pine tar, bay ram, and now working on the nautical sage, as well as the shampoo and conditioner. the soap is far beyond amazing, I have never felt so good stepping out of the shower in my life. the shampoo and conditioner is equally awesome, to the point i still smell the shampoo 2 to 3 days after washing my hair. just have to use double the amount of each if your man mane is half way down your back. keep up the good work guys, but keep your long haired squatchers in mind \m/",5,2017-04-15 04:00:00+00:00,503651566
True,Still Tingling,Hair Care Kit,"I just recieved my first order of soap, shampoo, and conditioner from you. I have to say I was very pleased. The soap scent lingers after the shower and I still smell the cedar on my skin. Since this was my FIRST use of your product I shampooed my hair first and then used your conditioner. Even after 30 minutes my scap still tingles. I have straight, fine, and oily hair so I will have to test this theory of ONLY shampooing one or two times a week, It remains to be seen if your conditioner will keep my hair cleen and oil free. I really feel cleaner than I have in, well a VERY long time. Three cheers for nice products and I will continue to use them.",5,2017-04-15 04:00:00+00:00,503651566

I've tried 4 scents so far and love them all will be making my way through the the rest of the scents with my soapscription! Can't wait to get theses next two in the mail. I get excited when my soapscription is fixing to renew. Another benefit, my ol' lady loves the scents and is always up in my face smelling me for like 2 hours after I shower(I swear I'm not trying to promote its the God honest truth) thanks Dr. Squatch for making the best soap I have and probably will ever use!

True,No soap better,Pine Tar,"Love the soap! Ordered my first bar of Pine Tar in January. I've tried quite a few of the other soaps (Citrus, Nautical Sage, and Gold Moss), but I've got to say that this is my favorite. Love the woodsy aroma and how well it exfoliates. Looking forward to my next batch! Once I've tried them all, I feel like I'll be pretty set on the Pine Tar. Looking forward to trying out your shampoo/conditioner.",5,2017-04-25 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,"Great feeling, bad smell?",Conditioner,I'm not smelling cool mint w/citrus as described above. I don't know if anyone has tried Meyer's hand soap but it has that sort of smell...kind of old timey. It's not the best smelling shampoo but the conditioner (and shampoo) really makes my hair feel great. I got an email a few days after I purchased saying they revamped their hair products...I wonder which version I received? Regardless...I wish it smelled better!,4,2017-04-25 04:00:00+00:00,83122952
True,Hope it pops up as my random again soon,Eucalyptus Yogurt,"When I first saw the Eucalyptus Greek Yogurt as the random pick of my soapscription, I wasn't overly impressed. Seemed rather feminine, and I wanted man soap. I was wrong. Smells great, cleaned like a champ, and the eucalyptus was a good picker-upper early in the mornings. Now that I'm out, I hope it reappears in my soapscription soon. 5 out of 5, keep up the great work!",5,2017-04-26 04:00:00+00:00,70700416
True,A Must Have,Pine Tar,The scent of Pine Tar really grabs you by the nose and lands a big uppercut right into your nostrils. The bar does seem to go fast despite using the soap saver; there is a noticeable difference in size even after the first use.,5,2017-04-27 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,One of my favorites,Gold Moss,"This is one of my favorites. I get this soap with every subscription. It is more of a manly scent and I like the way it lathers as well as moisturizes. I have dry skin on my shins and since using this soap, I never scratch my shins anymore. Can't go wrong with this soap.",5,2017-05-01 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
False,Great all around scent,Nautical Sage,"I like this soap and it's pretty much gender neutral. Great sea smell and decent lather. Moisturizes all right but not as good as Gold Moss or Aloe Vera. If you don't have really dry skin and you like a soap that has a very pleasing scent, this soap is for you.",4,2017-05-02 04:00:00+00:00,112874164
True,Good soap for men,Bay Rum,This scent is unique and more of a man type scent. Reminds me of a barbershop smell. It lathers really well and does moisturize really well. Not my favorite but still a good soap to try.,4,2017-05-02 04:00:00+00:00,70700670
False,Great scent,Cedar Citrus,"Another gender neutral scent that leaves your bathroom smelling great. Not an overpowering citrus smell, just right I would say. Not great at moisturizing but if you don't have dry skin and looking for a soap for a man and a woman, this soap is a good choice.",4,2017-05-02 04:00:00+00:00,70701577
True,My other favorite,Cool Fresh Aloe,"I really like the Gold Moss but just got the Cool Fresh Aloe and I'm impressed with the scent, lather, and moisturizing. This soap is perfect for both men and woman and will be part of my monthly soapsubscription",5,2017-05-02 04:00:00+00:00,70699856
True,I was sceptical,Hair Care Kit,"I have to admit, I really wasn't expecting much when I decided to add this for a trial. If you follow the directions and use the shampoo 2 to 3 times a week and condition everyday, it really leaves your hair soft and no dry scalp. I've always struggled to find a good shampoo and conditioner that just didn't leave my scalp all itchy. Even the ones that were designed to address that. This works awesome and now this is my main shampoo and conditioner.",5,2017-05-02 04:00:00+00:00,503651566
True,just love it.,Nautical Sage,Nothing like that great smell of sage in the morning or after a hard day's work.,5,2017-05-03 04:00:00+00:00,112874164
True,Best. . .Soap. . .Ever.,Gold Moss,I've been using this soap for about a year now and it's the best soap I've ever used.,5,2017-05-04 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
True,Pine Tar Soap,Pine Tar,"Great variety of soap, clean , fresh, long lasting. A bar lasted me a month, and for the price no complaints. Highly recommend, I ordered 4 bars and I'm into the Pine Tar.",5,2017-05-05 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,So fresh so clean,Cool Fresh Aloe,I just used this soap for the first time and it is phenomenal. I've never felt so clean! Only thing is I wish it had a stronger sent.,5,2017-05-06 04:00:00+00:00,70699856
False,Scent and exfoliation is great but don't get the soap around your manly parts,Pine Tar,"I liked the the bar overall just wish it was bigger and lasted longer at this price point. My main problem with the soap is the oatmeal and sand that is in the bar. This may seem odd to say but if I lather or rinse the soap off and some of it comes in contact with my pee hole it has a burning sensation and is painful. I am convinced its because of the sand/oatmeal particles that are in the soap that is causing this. it only lasts for a minute or two but it was enough for me to not want to buy it again. 

Has this happened to any other guys? I find it hard to believe I am the only one having this occurrence when I shower with the soap.",2,2017-05-09 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

False,Smell not strong enough.,Bay Rum,"The soap was great, but the smell wasn't strong enough. He actual bar smelled fine, but the lather and afterwards didn't.",3,2017-05-12 04:00:00+00:00,70700670
True,Great soap,Eucalyptus Yogurt,I decided to try this soap based on others reviews. This soap smells very good and cleans very well. I will be ordering more.,5,2017-05-14 04:00:00+00:00,70700416
False,I never received it,Pine Tar,It was suppose to be delivered on May 11th and the tracking stopped when DHL was supposed to deliver it to the post office. This happened to two of my friends and I.,1,2017-05-17 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Wow!,Pine Tar,This is my second order but the first order of Pine tar. It does what it says! It great for scrubbing off the gunk and stuff! Great smell too! You outdid yourself Doc!,5,2017-05-18 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

True,The best soap from Dr. Squatch.,Pine Tar,"Hands down the best. Great scent, hard soap that lasts. Cleans and exfoliates and the invigorating feeling it leaves you with is amazing.",5,2017-05-23 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Very nice.,Nautical Sage,Overall all a very nice soap. Lathers and cleans well. Nice scent. Does a great job and high quality.,5,2017-05-23 04:00:00+00:00,112874164
True,A nice scent,Bay Rum,A try bay rum with a modern edge. Cleans well and high quality. Not overpowering.,5,2017-05-23 04:00:00+00:00,70700670
False,Not what I expected.,Cool Fresh Aloe,This one is lacking something that their other soaps get right. The bar is softer and last half as long. Also the scent wanes quickly from the bar. If the scent was improved and a harder soap... I would try again.,3,2017-05-23 04:00:00+00:00,70699856
True,Great Soap!,Pine Tar,"I never write reviews, but I am compelled to do it here because I everyone should try this stuff (so that they remain in business forever because now I can't go back to my old soap)! I've tried the pine tar and nautical sage so far and both are great! They both smell great and much manlier than any store bought soap I've ever used. The smell doesn't linger for very long, but I attribute that to how extremely well they rinse off. My wife wasn't thrilled about the grey residue left from the pine tar soap (not that it was any big deal to rinse away) so I'll probably be sticking to other bars. I'm going to continue to work my way through the line anyway to try them all. In all honesty, my skin has never felt cleaner or more refreshed in my life. FYI: Using a rag and storing my soap on the soap saver outside the shower, mine are lasting a little over two weeks.",5,2017-05-23 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

True,Very Impressed!,Hair Care Kit,"I've experimented with a lot of shampoos and conditioners in my life (I have thick, wavy and frizzy hair that's pretty hard to manage), but I now I can say that as long as this stuff is around, the search for the perfect combination is over. I'm going with the wash once a week and condition daily approach, and have been doing so for about three weeks now. The idea of shampooing only once a week made me uncomfortable at first, but this shampoo gets your hair feeling so clean, that it isn't a problem at all. The conditioner keeps it fresh and smelling good (and the shampoo and conditioner do smell great and not feminine at all) throughout the rest of the week. My hair has never looked better or healthier! And since you only need a little bit for each use, it'll last a very long time.",5,2017-05-23 04:00:00+00:00,503651566
True,Best Cologne Ever!,Cologne Samples,"I haven't worn cologne in quite some time, but I figured I'd give this a shot since I was ordering a few other things here. I'm happy I did! The Hemlock Trail smells great, but it's just not really my sort of thing. A little too piney and woodsy smelling for me (it sounds weird, but this scent seems better suited for a dude with a full beard or something). The Driftwood, however, is the best smelling cologne I've ever used. I'm not real good at describing colognes, but I'd say this has an earthy smell with touches of sandalwood and some citrus too it. Its got a manly smell that's real clean. It's not overpowering either (which is good in my opinion since I just like it to be subtle). I only use two tiny drops on neck and it lasts throughout the day. I wish the big bottle were cheaper, but seeing as though I've only used about two-thirds of the Driftwood sample over the past three weeks (and I've used it daily), I guess it'd last me a real long time. I'll definitely buy the big bottle of Driftwood when my sample runs out!",5,2017-05-23 04:00:00+00:00,70705703
False,"It works well, but I have one quirk with it",Travel Bag,"I've been using this bag for use at the gym, so I clean up after a workout or if I have time on my lunch break, and I feel like I need a shower. In the time I've used the bag, it's definitely useful, but it has a problem worth mentioning. The good news is it does dry quickly, but the bad news is the soap ends up getting stuck with the weave and has pieces of it on my soap. So when I take it out I have to rinse it before use. 

I'm thinking a different fabric might be in order, something very breathable, but dries fast and isn't dripping wet like other bags might be.",3,2017-05-26 04:00:00+00:00,543921815
True,Essential!,Soap Saver,"Not just for drying your soap bar. The bar will adhere to this thing, and that is a good thing because you now can grip it instead of a bar of slippery soap. Another cool thing is that once your soap is about done, just use your next bar of soap and plop it on top of the old soap surface, and there you go. After awhile, you will have built up layers of soap, kind of reminiscent of sedimentary rock.",5,2017-05-27 04:00:00+00:00,70698419
True,One of my favorites,Bay Rum,Give this one a try. It smells great!,5,2017-05-29 04:00:00+00:00,70700670
True,Too Earthy,Hair Care Kit,"I purchased both the shampoo and conditioner. Like most of the reviewers - I must say I was a little skeptical at first to not use the shampoo every day. It has been about a month now and I think the best combination for me (since I workout 5 to 6 days a week) is to shampoo 2 to 3 times a week and condition every day. Now that the month is over my hair looks good and my scalp feels fine. However, I must admit my scalp broke out during the first two weeks . . . . I am calling that the adjustment period ... Lastly - smell-wise . . . the shampoo smells nice and fresh - but, the conditioner is a little to ""earthy"" for my taste. My opinion - less ""earth"" in the conditioner and you have a 5-Star product combo!",4,2017-05-29 04:00:00+00:00,503651566
False,Starts out strong . . . finishes weak.,Bay Rum,"To date I have tried both the Bay Rum and Nautical Sage soaps. Bay Rum is definitely my favorite so far! The Nautical Sage started out a little too strong on the ""sage side"" - but, seeing as the sent has all but disappeared after 1 weeks use - it is no longer a problem. Like most of the complaints below - you are lucky to get the physical bar to last a full month. To give potential users some perspective: 1.) I do shower daily - sometimes twice a day depending on my workout schedule, 2.) I am not super ""Squatchy"" hairy - but do sport a healthy coverage throughout/overall - so I am sure that uses more soap. As to complaints about the bar falling apart - both of mine have not. I did make sure to purchase the Squatch soap holder and that seems to help. Lastly - I have taken the remnants of my first bar of soap and put it and some water into my ""TSA approved shampoo container"" and created a usable liquid soap for use on my business trips (hint, hint, Dr. Squatch - when are you coming out with some liquid soaps???). Bottom line - yes, I would buy again. Love the natural approach and the initial scent. I look forward to trying the other scents. Just wish the bars would last longer.",3,2017-05-29 04:00:00+00:00,70700670
True,Absolutely NEVER going back!,Pine Tar,"I vow to never use commercial body wash or bar soap again. Saw Dr. Squatch ads on Facebook and instantly was hooked after my first order. Pine Tar is arguably the best smelling soap I've ever used, and the ingredients keep my skin smooth and smelling great. I keep mine in a soap dish to save its longevity as well as smell up my bathroom with Piney goodness. The scrub/exfoliation is a really nice touch and it feels good and not too abrasive. Love this soap. You have a returning customer here!",5,2017-06-01 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,Love your products but hate your shipping times.,Pine Tar,My favorite bar to date but shipping from a neighboring state should not take 10+ days.,3,2017-06-01 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Scents doesn't stick around,Cedar Citrus,"The quality of soap is fine, easy to lather and smell good in the shower, but by the time you dry off that good scent is gone. It's my second scent to try and a little disappointed",3,2017-06-05 04:00:00+00:00,70701577
False,Great Lather with an Excellent Scent that Peters Out Really Fast.,Nautical Sage,"So I received my Nautical Sage bar of soap today. First thing I noticed was when I ripped open the padded envelope it comes in, that beautiful Nautical Sage scent hit me in the old olfactory nerves and scent me to heaven. I couldn't wait to try it out. It cam in a nice little box with ingredients listed on it and a little blurb about the story of Dr. Squatch. Well lets get to the important stuff. Now I'm a guy who likes his soap to lather and I also like the scent of the soap to last at least half the day if not longer. Well this soap delivers in the lather department for sure and the scent permeates through the whole bathroom while you're using it. Sadly that wonderful Nautical Sage scent goes straight down the drain as soon as you rinse the soap off. I was so disappointed in this soap as far as how long the scent lasts. When you have so many different scents to offer in your products and that scent only lasts while you're in the shower, I'd say you're doing your customers a disservice because that bar of soap costs upwards of $7 to $10 and that aint cheap for a bar of soap. Yeah it's natural and all but the scent is 90% of the sale. Bottom line, if I'm going to pay an arm and a leg for a bar of soap, I want that arm and leg to smell like that bar of soap for most of the day. Pun intended. I'm sorry to say that when I'm done with my wonderful bar of Dr. Squatch Nautical Sage soap, I'll be moving on and this time I wont be so foolish as to fall for some newfangled natural great smelling soap. Thank you Dr. Squatch for a great time in the shower, even though it didn't last, I still wish you good luck and may you be prosperous in the years to come.",3,2017-06-06 04:00:00+00:00,112874164
False,No Actual Aloe,Cool Fresh Aloe,"First time I've been disappointed with a Dr Squatch product. 

While it smells nice, and all that jazz, there's no actual Aloe Vera in the ingredients list. Bummer.... If you like to smell like aloe without any of the actual benefits of Aloe (I got this to use in the summer months), then go on ahead and snag this one up.",2,2017-06-07 04:00:00+00:00,70699856

False,Soap is good. Overpriced,Gold Moss,I used this soap first as part of my 3 bar trial. Soap is a good product but nothing exceptional.

True,"Overpriced, decent product",Cedar Citrus,I used this soap second as part of my 3 bar trial. Soap is a good product but nothing exceptional.

True,Product is just OK. Leaves black marks on the shower walls,Pine Tar,I used this soap first as part of my 3 bar trial. Soap is a good product but nothing exceptional. Tends to be used up quickly and smell is a little too subtle. Definitely a nice to have not need to have item. This soap leaves black marks on the white shower walls. My evaluation is $4-5 per bar and the trial of 3 soaps at $27 is not a great way to attract new customers.,2,2017-06-08 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

True,"Great soap, inconsistent scent",Dr. Squatch Favorites Pack,"Tried 3 bars of soap: pine tar, gold moss and cedar citrus. First thing, I noticed I did not need oils after a red hot shower; no itch, no dryness, I have almost stopped using the moisturizers I've used for years after the first bar. Love the pine tar, scent and exfoliation is perfect. Gold Moss, while it performed well, almost had no scent. Little disappointed. Cedar citrus; almost no exfoliant, and scent was barely there. Again, a little disappointed. I was expecting more ""in your face"" scent out of the second two, but performance is still stunning. I'm an ""ashy white guy"" most of the time and the soaps alone seemed to have fixed that. Cool. No more having to grease down after a shower.",4,2017-06-09 04:00:00+00:00,203407568
True,Best soap I have used!,Dr. Squatch Favorites Pack,"Been using their soap for a few months and absolutely LOVE IT!!

True,I'm a customer for life.,Pine Tar,"I spend my days teaching people how to break other people. It is hot, sweaty work and creates a stench. But deodorant soaps are filled with chemicals that should be in a battery, not on my skin. Dr. Squatch Pine Tar smells manly, not perfumey. Chemical free and exfoliating like a real man, with oatmeal and freaking sand!
Buy this.

True,Good soap,Cedar Citrus,"I really enjoyed the cedar citrus. Lasted 4 weeks by putting up high and away from the water. Smell was good but didn't last long. One major issue I have is I didn't see a benefit switching to this soap nor did I see any worse affect once I finished the bar. I use either dove or old spice bar soap and cannot see any benefit. If the price was lower, I might consider another purchase. Overall, a very good bar of soap. Would love to try the other smells as well.",4,2017-06-18 04:00:00+00:00,70701577
True,Love,Deep Sea Goats Milk,"My skin Thanks, the Ladies Thank you as well. I love this soap. I've used several different genres of the soaps.

I had severe psoriasis and this has tamed it and kept it at bay after just one bottle. You've got a repeat customer Dr. Squatch!",5,2017-06-23 04:00:00+00:00,503651566

True,Best shampoo/conditioner I've used,Hair Care Kit,"I used to use old spice and axe shampoo and thought it was amazing. After trying this I realize it's not. This is by far the greatest shampoo I've ever used. I will be using this as long as it's around. I love the smell of it and how I can smell it throughout the day, but it's not over powering either which is great. Not as good smelling as the soaps tho. Was also impressed with the free shipping on this. I'm subscribed to soap scription and knew I got free shipping on it but figured I'd be charged shipping for the hair care since I didn't have a hair care subscription. The Dr. Squatch for great products all around. I can't wait to try the cologne. Hey, maybe you guys can make deodorant next?",5,2017-06-24 04:00:00+00:00,503651566
False,Bad Soap,Shave Bar,"Soap doesn't lather right no matter what you do. Water more, water less, whip it this way or that way nothing. Lather comes out thin and doesn't provide much for cushion, slickness, or protection. Save your money and purchase else where. Product is very expensive as well.",1,2017-06-29 04:00:00+00:00,83120728

True,Still Good,Travel Bag,"I pinged Dr Squatch a while ago about the idea of a dish of some sort so I could keep/use their soap at the gym. I was thinking of a hard plastic case, like a normal soap dish, but one Squatch shaped. Then they came out with this travel bag. Bought it as soon as I saw it. I was concerned about the material; putting a wet soap bar into and then the bag into my dopp kit. Still no problems. The bag started to darken, as if it was getting wet or getting moldy, and would soon leak. It is moisture, but it still doesn't leak. The better feature, over a plastic soap dish, is that it does dry out the soap. Very content.",5,2017-07-05 04:00:00+00:00,543921815
True,Showering at a whole new level,Pine Tar,"I don't know if it was destiny or my deep seated love for sasquatch that made me click on the Facebook ad, but my showering life will never be the same. I'm a man of the outdoors, and I am overjoyed to find a company that allows me to bathe in its scents. Showering has become my favorite part of the day. There are times I find myself going into the bathroom just to smell my soaps. They're that good. Also, I have had issues with dry skin my whole life, and the pine tar soap scrubs and cleans my skin thoroughly without drying it out. If anything, my skin is in better condition than ever before. Needless to say, I now have a subscription and am currently waiting for my hair kit to come in the mail.",5,2017-07-09 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

True,Not for people who have naturally oily hair,Hair Care Kit,"I have naturally oily hair and I tried the recommendation of only washing my hair 2-3 times a week and using the conditioner daily, my hair just simply can't do this. By day 2, my hair was so oily that it looked like I had been working out and my hair was wet. I love the way the product smells, but if you are someone with naturally oily hair, you have two options either not buy or wash your hair every day.

False,cleans but with a cost,Pine Tar,I find the smell to be a little weird but not unpleasant. It does wash off black and could make the shower a little messy. My biggest complaint though is how gritty it is. All the sand makes it too abrasive and almost painful to wash with. All that being said if you used any of their other soaps you still leave the shower with that clean fresh feeling,3,2017-08-12 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

The positive, though - it definitely gets your hair clean, without leaving it feeling too dry like some other all-natural shampoos. Smelling like a cleaning agent, it better leave my hair nice and dirt/oil free.",3,2017-08-16 04:00:00+00:00,83122902
False,"OK, kinda",Travel Bag,"Right out of the box, the Travel Bag appears to be well thought thru, i.e., the bar fits nicely, closes quickly and travels well in my spa bag. I go to the gym maybe 5 times a week so it gets a good workout. I had just finished showering with my favorite soap, the Cool Fresh Aloe, I shook the excess water from the bar, placed back in to the bag and then into my spa kit. The next day, as I was preparing to shower, I reached for the Travel Bag and it was already fairly soaked. I open and pulled the soap out and it had become fairly soft, almost to the point of decomposing. A portion of the soap was still inside the bag, unavailable for me to use in the shower. I found this to be unacceptable. I went to my CVS Pharmacy and purchased a plastic soap container for under a dollar and that appeared to have solved the problem. I love your products but this particular item does not meet expectations.",2,2017-08-17 04:00:00+00:00,543921815
True,New soap,Cedar Citrus,"I was looking for another soap to use because my Dove Men's favorite isn't always in stock and that bugs me. So I went on a search and found Dr. Squatch. I decided to give it a shot I bought 2 bars one Cedar Citrus and Bay Rum. I started with the Cedar because the quiz recommended that one. So far it has not dried my skin out. Since my hospital ordeal my skin is thin. I like the scent of the Cedar Citrus and from what I smell of the Bay Rum can't wait to try that one.
I am hoping the product continues to preform. If the bar doesn't last that long that's okay as long as I don't have to use lotions as much. Sorry for the long rant but thought I would give a decent review to help others choose. Also I forgot I am also Diabetic which leads to dry skin or skin issues.

True,Gold Moss,Gold Moss,"After reading reviews a couple of years ago I decided to try Gold Moss and fell so much in love with it that i immediately subscribed and have been using ever since. This is the best soap I've ever used hands down and I love the Gold Moss so much I'm afraid to try other scents. I just don't see how anything else will measure up and don't want to be disappointed. After writing this though, I think I'll bite the bullet and order a couple other scents to try....going with Pine Tar and Nautical Sage...wish me luck!!",5,2017-08-20 04:00:00+00:00,70701905

True,AAA Product and Customer Service,Dr. Squatch Favorites Pack,"Aside from the fact that I have been far more pleased with this soap than any other soap or body wash I have used, The customer service has been simply amazing. Had some issues with shipping times, and issues with the system when trying to make a purchase, and they cleared it right up. Greg actually talked to me like I was a person, not another number in a ledger, and it was great. My issues were taken care of quickly, and I'm on to trying a couple of new bars.

True,Outstanding,Pine Tar,"I work in the tree business and this soap smells dead on like the pine trees I work around. I can still smell the soap and feel it's skin soothing effects 3 hours after my shower; that's awesome. Best soap I ever used and I will continue to get it here forth. Let me tell you, my line of work is a dirty one and this soap lather well and cleans my skin after a long ahed day of dirt, sweat, and wood chips.",5,2017-08-24 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,Average,Pine Tar,"I'm new to Dr. Squatch, and want to give it a fair shot. Admittedly, the price is higher than any commercial soap. That, right off the bat has me thinking this has GOT to be special to be worth the additional expense. Like most informed consumers, I read the reviews prior to purchasing. They sounded so good I seldom found a negative. ""Hm. Only employees writing reviews?"", I wondered. Looking for a woodsy, pine scent that lasts with a natural bar, I gave this a shot. 

Much ado about not much, to be honest. Everybody is different. But based on the comments, I was expecting to be knocked out with the strength of the smell of pine and all things forest. Not so. Because of the reviews and comments, this was weak. 

Not a fan of exfoliating. But that was my choice. But I was looking for a natural bar soap with a lasting aroma. I was hoping to have found the Holy Grail of my quest, but ultimately realize that its not so. 

I would not order this again because exfoliating annoys me and this just didn't deliver as advertised. The scent faded as soon as it washed off. 

I have also ordered Bay Rum with this and I DO like the smell of that right out of the box. Haven't used it yet as I am going 1 bar at a time. But I'm disappointed in the weakness of the Pine Tar.",3,2017-08-27 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Amazing... and manly!,Hair Care Kit,"I've been using Dr. Squatch since January, when I got a few bars of soap for a Christmas gift. Pine tar is my favorite, but all of them are great on my skin. No more scratchy, dry skin! Even more amazing was that it left my shower cleaner too. So, I thought I'd branch out and try the shampoo and conditioner. All I can say is... Awesome! I was a little unsure about the recommended usage, but only using the shampoo 3 times a week and the conditioner every day has been great. My hair used to get oily quickly, but this stuff has changed that. Makes me wonder if the shampoo I was using was really working. I love the manly scent, especially on the conditioner. That cool feeling it leaves behind is refreshing. We have very hard water here, but my hair has never been cleaner, and it so much easier to style. On the day I used both the soap and the shampoo and conditioner, I chopped 2 cords of wood and tamed the coyote pack living behind my house, in just one hour. We hang out and tell stories. Good stuff. So good in fact, that I'm buying extra, just in case.",5,2017-08-27 04:00:00+00:00,503651566

True,Best conditioner and shampoo,Hair Care Kit,"My scalp get dry and flaky a lot and I've tried a wide range of products for men such as Head and shoulders, dove care, axe, selsun Blue, old spice, and even Suave. At the end of the day they all left my hair flaky, dry and itchy. Dr Squatch is the first to leave my hair soft, non flaky and feeling amazing for days to come. I try to conditioner my hair everyday as Dr squatch has mentioned above but some days I don't and I'll go 2 days without doing it and my hair still feels soft and not dry or flaky and that's including me only shampooing my hair twice in a week. This stuff is truly amazing and will be all that I use now on and possibly for ever.",5,2017-09-03 04:00:00+00:00,503651566
False,"Nothing special, has some value though. 2 stars, might buy more...",Pine Tar,"This is the most abrasive bar of soap ever. I say that in a good way. It's like having a belt sander in your shower. Any dead skin cells and dirt deposits don't stand a chance against this scrub. Some people may not like that. I love it.

The let down, for me, is in the fragrance, or lack there of. It smells very, very good if you sniff the bar, but the smell does not translate to the skin at all. After drying off, it's almost gone. By the time I get to work (30 minutes later) my skin smells like nothing. No good woodsy ""Dr. Squatch"" type of...anything. 

As a skin exfoliation bar, I absolutely LOVE IT!!! My problem areas (exfoliation-wise) are never a problem when I use this. I will say however that, when I use it, my butthole seems more itchy soon after then when I use some regular-ass soap from the store like ""Coast"" or ""Dial"" or even ""Lever 2000"". 

The smell claims are why I bought this product. They were... dissapointing. The exfoliation properties may make me buy more. (maybe, it's really that good) 

Buy this product if you have issues with dry skin that the commercially availible soaps are too ""soft"" for. Don't expect to smell any better.",2,2017-09-04 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Best of the best,Dr. Squatch Favorites Pack,I was breaking out with horrible rash all over my body and other soaps were causing it to get worse. I heard about dr. Squatch and thought it was expensive and very skeptic because every company claims their product is the best. But I am a believer now. The scents are amazing and last a long time. I never felt cleaner coming out the shower. And my rash is slowly disappearing and I've only been using the soap for a week now.

True,Amazing Soap,Cool Fresh Aloe,I've been squatchin' for about a month now and I have to be honest...I wasn't sure what to expect in the beginning. I was drawn in by the scent names and actually having ingredients that I could pronounce properly but I wasn't sure how well these soaps would work. I signed up for the soapscription with a code that got me 25% off my first box and let Squatch pick my two scents. This was one of the two. I am very pleased I was sent this one first! It feels AMAZING on my skin and the scent it so refreshing. I actually get excited to take a shower when I know I am using this soap! Thanks Squatch!

False,My Truth,Cedar Citrus,"I would like to say that I'm a bit disappointed with this soap. Although it is supposed to have the citrus scent, I did not get that AT ALL. The smell of mint and cedar takes over, like there is no orange present. I feel a bit deceived with my first try at this company. The soap goes on pretty well. You don't need to use much, but the scent does not stick after the shower. I want to try more scents to give the company a chance to redeem themselves, but $10 is too much to waste. Not sure if I will try another.",2,2017-09-21 04:00:00+00:00,70701577

True,my 2nd bar,Gold Moss,This was the second bar I've tried its probably the closes to a scent you'd find in a store and i love the moisturizer and how it makes my skin feel,4,2017-10-02 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
True,my 3rd bar,Cedar Citrus,my 3rd and the bar im on now the scent is great and it gets a very deep scrub that feels very clean i wish they made XL versions i would get this one,5,2017-10-02 04:00:00+00:00,70701577
True,a great way in,Dr. Squatch Favorites Pack,This is a great way to try out this line of products and the soap saver is a nice extra the should make a bundle with smaller versions and all the scents so you can find the one you like the most,5,2017-10-02 04:00:00+00:00,203407568
True,Pure Magic,Gold Moss,"This soap has an incredible scent....rich, spicy, and the lather is incredible. I have dry skin, especially in the winter, and this soap seems to moisturize my skin. Will always be one of my favorite Squatch soaps.",5,2017-10-03 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
False,Smells good BUT does not last very long at all.,Pine Tar,"I have to be honest I liked the smell of the soap, but for $7 per bar I was expecting a lot more out of this bar of soap than 2 weeks total out of it. I was hoping for at least the same amount of time as I get out of a bar of dove especially how big this bar is when you get it. Just for clarification I used a soap saver too with it so it wasn't sitting in water for any extended period of time or anything it just simply does not last. If I had the money to blow on soap sure it smells and cleans nice but I am not gonna pay $7 a bar for something that just doesn't last like it should.",2,2017-10-11 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Great Soaps!,Pine Tar,"If you haven't tried these soaps, you're missing out. My favorites are Cedar Citrus, Gold Moss and (for that extra clean feeling) pine tar. I suggest once you choose your subscription to choose Squatch picks that way you can try them all. Seriously get your subscription today.",5,2017-10-24 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Pine tactic!,Pine Tar,Smells like I showerd in pine sap! I love that the scent is very strong. It didn't smell that good just smelling it but once you lather it on.......You'll be caught in the pines :thinking:,5,2017-10-28 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,Smelled great at first.,Cedar Citrus,"Just smelling from the box it smells better than pine tar at first but it's weak. I could barley smell it during the shower, even less afterwards.",4,2017-10-28 04:00:00+00:00,70701577
False,A mix of campfire and cigarette smoke.,Beechwood Bourbon,If musky smokey scents is your thing then go for it. I gave a low review because it's strong at first but even just driving it's almost completely gone after 10 minutes just driving.,2,2017-10-28 04:00:00+00:00,70704176
False,Loved the scent while it lasted.,Crushed Pine,"Loved the scent but it's so weak after about 10 minutes. I tried it on my beard,wrist and clothes. At 42 dollars and the sample being so faint quickly I'm a little hesitant to buy a full size bit I did love the scent.",3,2017-10-28 04:00:00+00:00,86211176
True,Awesome Squatch & Awesome Scent!!,Pine Tar,"I am a very recent first time buyer of Squatch products. This Pine Tar scent is awesome! I work 12 hour shifts in an environment that is dirty, dusty, and all things in between. This soap not only is an awesome scent to wake up to in the shower, but it is equally great if not better when coming home from work to wash away all the day's dirt. It also makes my bathroom smell great just having the bar in my shower. I wish you guys made jar candles in this same Pine Tar scent because I would totally buy it and it would make my whole place smell awesome. I also received my order very quickly, only 3 days in fact. I also ordered the Bay Rum scent and will do another review for it when I start using it. I plan to only buy my soap from Dr. Squatch from now on!",5,2017-10-30 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,great stuff!,Pine Tar,"i was pleasantly surprised when i tried this soap. love the scent, made my skin softer and love the scrubbing of the oatmeal. . the only thing is the scent doesnt stay long.",4,2017-10-31 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,good stuff!,Bay Rum,"once again Dr. Squatch comes in with a win. like the scent, skin felt clean and soft. scent doesnt last long.",4,2017-10-31 04:00:00+00:00,70700670
True,Great Stuff!,Cool Fresh Aloe,they come in with yet another win. the aloe really makes for soft skin and it lathers up very nicely.,4,2017-10-31 04:00:00+00:00,70699856
True,Great stuff!,Dr. Squatch Favorites Pack,"im only on my second month of the soapscription. i have gotten to try 3 different bars so far. they all have their own very distinct scents which i like a lot so far. they all have great lather and leave a nice fresh clean feeling on the skin. the only thing is, after i get out of the shower the scent doesnt last long after the shower. i have been getting almost exactly 2 weeks per bar. i will continue getting soap from Dr. Squatch. i recently just ordered the shampoo and conditioner. i expect the i will be just as satisfied as with the soaps",4,2017-10-31 04:00:00+00:00,203407568
True,DR. Squatch is absolutely the BEST!,Pine Tar,"Pin Tar for the win! I’ve tried so many products that I can’t even count that high LOL. But no more, because you guys make the absolute best soap on the market!!!! No one can come close to you all!!! Thank u soooo much for the great customer service to the extremely fast shipping!! U all are Rawkin!!!!!",5,2017-11-03 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Amazing!!!,Gold Moss,By far my favorite scent out of all of the soaps! Amazing smell and leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.,5,2017-11-16 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
True,Game-changing,Pine Tar,This soap is a game changer. The soap smells amazing and leaves you feeling great. Highly recommend it.,5,2017-11-17 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,Refreshing!,Pine Tar,"First off, this soap is as black as a moonless night and leaves a dark residue in your shower. Make sure you rinse your shower well before it sticks or you'll have a bit of scrubbing to do. That doesn't detract from it though. The scent is very strong but doesn't leave that strong smell on your skin. There's only a light hint of pine once you rinse off. It lathers up very nicely and is great for cleaning your beard and even your scalp. This soap really stands out as an exfoliation tool. It has oatmeal and sand in it so it will remove a lot of dead skin while you scrub. You will FEEL clean after using this bar of soap! Highly recommended.",5,2017-11-18 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Quite Nice!,Gold Moss,"This soap is very mild both in feel and scent. The scent is mostly neutral with a hint of sweetness. It is pleasant in a simple, easy-to-appreciate way. The scent doesn't scream at you after your bath either which is a big plus. It's great for an every day soap. This soap really shines when you're shaving too. It produces a thick, smooth lather that clings to your skin. It does a fantastic job of lubricating your skin and helping your razor glide smoothly. I'll definitely be getting more of this!",5,2017-11-19 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
False,Complete garbage,Pine Tar,"This soap sucks. Lasts about 10 days and doesn’t smell that good. Also, they sent me only one bar for a two bar subscription and when I contacted them, they just kept saying they’d get back to me and never did. This company is a joke and I am the fourth of my friends to bail on them. Don’t waste your time or money. Seriously.",1,2017-11-23 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,Michael Williams,Shave Bar,Fair at best dries out fast causing more friction then needed but does it work? Yes it will get the job done as long as you prep properly.,2,2017-11-25 04:00:00+00:00,83120728
True,Love it!,Crushed Pine,"I have sensitive skin so most cologne makes me itch and turns me red. Not this stuff though. It doesn't cause me any discomfort and smells fantastic. I've gotten several compliments while wearing this scent already and it's only been about a week. While the scent is very nice it isn't loud or outlandish. It's very down-to-earth and subtle. On my skin, the citrus scent comes out pretty strong to start and then slowly gives way to the scent of evergreen. I've found my cologne from now on I think.",5,2017-11-29 04:00:00+00:00,86211176
True,Diggin' It!,Conditioner,"My hair has always been a problem for me. In the week that I've been using this conditioner my hair has become much more manageable. It's softer and shinier. I'm diggin' it! This conditioner also smells great which is an added bonus while your using it. My entire bathroom smells like this conditioner when I get done. It's a clean, smooth scent that I liked from the first time that I smelled it. Well worth the money.",5,2017-11-29 04:00:00+00:00,83122952
True,Powerful!,Shampoo,"After I used this shampoo, my hair and scalp were squeaky clean. LITERALLY. My hair squeaked after I rinsed and ran my hand through my hair. It strips, captures, and lifts every bit of oil and dirt off of your head without leaving any residue. I wouldn't be surprised if this shampoo was able to take ink stains out of a white shirt. All joking aside, make sure that you use the conditioner after using this. Your hair will thank you. Also, this shampoo smells even better than the conditioner. That is no small feat because the conditioner smells great. Another product that is well worth the money.",5,2017-11-29 04:00:00+00:00,83122902
False,Nice soap but not a fan of the smell.,Eucalyptus Yogurt,The soap itself is fine and i like the exfoliation but the smell just reminds me of something like a muscle rub. Out of the six different bars i ordered i wish i had not ordered two of these on the exfoliation factor alone.,3,2017-12-03 04:00:00+00:00,70700416
True,All natural Irish spring,Cool Fresh Aloe,Pretty much the all natural version of Irish spring soap. Very refreshing,4,2017-12-03 04:00:00+00:00,70699856
True,Favorite squatch soap thus far,Deep Sea Goats Milk,"So far this is my favorite scent so far. A nice lemon scent with a hint of mint, just wish the exfoliation was as aggressive or equal to the mint eucalyptus bar.",5,2017-12-03 04:00:00+00:00,70699496
False,Officially Switching,USPS Priority Mail,"I started using this product a couple of weeks ago, and I must say there is no better product that has cleaned so well and left my skin moisturized and smooth. The scents are subtle but awesome, and I couldn't get rid of my old products quickly enough!",5,2017-12-04 04:00:00+00:00,70275554
True,Colorado Proud,Travel Bag,"Was really excited for this bag, and still am. I absolutely love the quality. I am actually planning on picking another one up so i can have one to store unused bars, and one to carry around bars that i am using. I found that it handles wet bars very well. Was so excited to see my state flag inside. We take that VERY seriously here in CO, and i’m Boulder’s biggest squatch fan.",5,2017-12-04 04:00:00+00:00,543921815
False,Waste of $10 but better than $43,Cologne Samples,"I was excited waiting on the arrival of these colognes in hopes to finding a scent Id like to wear on a daily basis. Well these tiny bottles showed up and didn't sell me on wanting to risk spending the full boat on a bottle. They seem to smell ok, but its literally gone in seconds. I thought I was just used to the scent, but I asked others and they couldn't smell anything either. I wonder how these samples received a bulk of 5 stars. I didn't go through them all, but how do you give 5 stars and then say you wish it lasted longer?? And go as far as saying within an hour it was gone?? Sounds like a VERY generous review! I only gave it 2 stars because as my title displayed it saved me from spending $43 on a whole bottle so that was a positive. I am not happy reporting this as I was hoping to like it and order a bottle. Maybe if these samples came in a mini spray application it would've sold it better. IDK",2,2017-12-05 04:00:00+00:00,70705703
True,Very Happy with the Squatch!,Pine Tar,Just finishing my first bar of Pine Tar and am very happy with it. I have tried all of the products here and like them all. Glad I saw the site.,5,2017-12-06 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,"Cheaply Made, Soap Sticks to It",Soap Saver,"More like a paperweight. As the title states, the soap simply sticks to it.",1,2017-12-06 04:00:00+00:00,70698419
False,Great Soap,Gold Moss,Has all the great qualities I expect from Dr. Squatch just has a licorice smell I'm not fond of but still this is a great soap.,3,2017-12-09 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
True,Wow,Pine Tar,"Damn straight it is, I just opened my Box of Pine Tar Exfoliating Soap last night, and I have never felt so clean, and refreshed afterwards, for once not completely dried out, and the scent took me like the Pacific Northwest, and lasted through the night, I am thoroughly Impressed, I can't wait to try Cedar Citrus when this bar is through, well done Gents, Cheers:beers::thumbsup::thumbsup::clap::national_park::evergreen_tree: #10/10",5,2017-12-10 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,The Pine Tar is a grime killer!,Pine Tar,"As a mechanic it is hard to find a soap that knocks out grease and grime without drying your skin out. Pine Tar takes care of both, and it smells fantastic!",5,2017-12-10 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Pretty good,Cedar Citrus,The scent is nice but not very strong. The lather is not as thick as some of the other offerings. It does the job quite well though. This would be good for everyday use.,4,2017-12-10 04:00:00+00:00,70701577
True,It truly works!,Soap Saver,I used a few other soap savers because they were cheaper and didn’t get any extended time from each bar. So I finally got this one and let me tell you it extended my bar 10 extra days!! So this is well worth the price!!! Looks great and smells great!,5,2017-12-13 04:00:00+00:00,70698419
True,One of the best scents!,Deep Sea Goats Milk,I have now tried all the scents and this is one of my favorite ones! Love the smell and man does it moisturize!!!,5,2017-12-13 04:00:00+00:00,70699496
True,For the bearded man or for the lady,Cool Fresh Aloe,This is absolutely the best thing for a mans face especially if you have a beard!!! Also my wife loves this one the most and she gets this for her too!,5,2017-12-13 04:00:00+00:00,70699856
True,Unbelievably long lasting scent,Eucalyptus Yogurt,Love this one! And the scent last allllllllll day and night!!!,5,2017-12-13 04:00:00+00:00,70700416

True,My #1,Pine Tar,"I have tried all of their scents and this is the very best one! Many compliments when I use this one! Great for the bearded man too!! If you are on the fence about trying any of their soaps, then get this one first! You instantly will become a believer and a lifelong customer! Plus these guys go above and beyond with their customers!",5,2017-12-13 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Did not know what I was thinking when I ordered Nautical Sage...BUT......,Nautical Sage,"Did not know what I was thinking when I ordered this flavor...BUT...this is excellent. The soaps are great, but the Nautical Sage scent is amazing. You'll must get a bar to discover it for yourself.",5,2017-12-13 04:00:00+00:00,112874164
False,Not pleased. Sticker right on the box and now I can’t get it off,Best Sellers Gift Box,Just looks horrible with the sticker all smudged into the box... not happy with this.

False,I was a bit disappointed,Pine Tar,"This was the first bar I ordered after reading so many reviews. I'm not huge on exfoliation, however, if you're looking for a bar that exfoliates very well, then THIS BAR is for you! It had an ""OK"" smell to me, however, for my first bar I was somewhat left disappointed. I ended up liking my second bar of Bay Rum, much better.",3,2017-12-15 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,Doesn't work and over priced!,Soap Saver,"Terrible product,over priced to start with,and like the other1star reviews I agree, despite its claim not to stick......it does.
I like the soap I'm on a subscription and will stay. I also bought the travel bag haven't used it yet,but it doesn't look very good
A pie of burlap that will soak up and stick to what ever it packed to. Could have made on out of a spud sack,Cologne is also missing it projections! Stick to the soap people you'll be better off. I emailed twice without response,other than we'll get back to you,here's some music ti dance to.",1,2017-12-15 04:00:00+00:00,70698419
False,It's ok....but not worth $18.00 a bottle,Shampoo,I bought this shampoo expecting something special. I was a little disappointed after washing my hair the first time using it.......don't get me wrong it does the job but no better than a $8.00 bottle I can get at any Walmart and it has a funky smell........ It wasn't anything special and definitely not worth $18.00 for that size bottle...,2,2017-12-20 04:00:00+00:00,83122902
False,A little itchy,Gold Moss,This one required a little more rinsing and left me with a tolerable itch. The itch might be a me thing though with this scent.,2,2017-12-21 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
True,Amazing,Spearmint Basil,The water bill went up for sure.,5,2017-12-21 04:00:00+00:00,70701388
True,Best purchase ever!,Hair Care Kit,"I have naturally straight and oily hair, so washing my hair once or twice a day wasn't uncommon. I tried several brands but none seemed to work and the shampoo/conditioner combos made my hair even more greasy. Hence I was skeptical on using this conditioner everyday. However, after almost two months of continuous use I noticed my hair feels stronger and thicker and can last the entire day without becoming overly oily and gross. The conditioner really works to remove excess oil and keep the hair feeling clean throughout the day, and on the two days a week I do shampoo, holy squatch! My hair feels like a lion's mane flowing majestically through the breeze. A must have product for any man who desires cleaner, softer, and stronger hair.",5,2017-12-22 04:00:00+00:00,503651566

True,Seriously Amazing,Deep Sea Goats Milk,"I have used a few of the Dr. Squatch soaps and while they are all great, the Deep Sea Goats Milk takes the cake. Seriously one of the best soaps i’ve ever used. My skin is still incredibly soft and moisturized hours after showering. Can not recommend it enough!",5,2017-12-23 04:00:00+00:00,70699496
True,Refreshing!,Cool Fresh Aloe,"This bar is awesome for shaving! It makes a thick lather that clings to the skin and rinses away cleanly. My razor glided smoothly over my face and the aloe helped to prevent razor burn. 

The scent is pleasant but not something that I will rave about. It's simply a fresh, clean smell. This would be a great bar for folks with dry skin or those that want a smooth shave.",4,2017-12-27 04:00:00+00:00,70699856
True,Love your soaps!,Nautical Sage,These soaps are tremendous! No more itchy dry skin for me. They all smell great too!:thumbsup:,5,2017-12-30 04:00:00+00:00,112874164
True,"Without a doubt, the best soap I have ever used.",Gold Moss,"I am absolutely in love with this soap. I suffer from extremely dry skin due to a medication I take, and Dr Squatch is the only soap that leaves me feeling clean, without having dry tight skin. In addition, my wife loves how I smell after showering. This is a big deal because my wife HATES scented body products. I can't say enough good things about this bar soap. I recommend it to anyone and everyone.",5,2018-01-01 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
True,Great smell!,Bay Rum,This is a great smelling bar of soap! Very sweet and strong. The scent fills the entire bathroom. It makes good lather too. I like washing my beard with the Bay Rum bar.,5,2018-01-04 04:00:00+00:00,70700670
True,Amazing for your hair and scalp!,Hair Care Kit,"I've literally been using stuff to counter the effects of bad hair products for several years now. This has given me the opportunity to stop buying all those things that damage my hair and scalp, and doing things to correct the problems that they had caused. The shampoo and conditioner are 2nd to none and they smell great too! Everyone should have these! My scalp was suffering so bad before using these two products!

Thank you so much Dr. Squatch!",5,2018-01-08 04:00:00+00:00,503651566
False,Good but not my fave,Nautical Sage,"One of the things that I love the most about Dr. Squatch soap is the scent. This bar has a very faint scent compared to the other bars that I've tried. It's a shame because I love the scent of sage. You can barely smell this bar though. On the upside, this bar makes good lather and rinses away clean. This is per usual with Dr. Squatch. Make the scent a little stronger and this would be a dynamite bar of soap.",3,2018-01-10 04:00:00+00:00,112874164
True,Best. Soap. Ever!,Nautical Sage,"This is hands down, the best, hydrateness, bodily cleanselinessing, refreshingly sent applicator, bar of soap. Such as CEDAR CITRIUS, I have ever bought. The smell reminded me of the old cedar jungle gyms I use to play on as wee lad.
So BRAVO!
You have earned yourself a new loyal customer!",5,2018-01-12 04:00:00+00:00,112874164
True,My Favorite,Gold Moss,"Tried 4 types of Dr.Squatch soaps so far. This is my favorite, with Bay Rum a close second. Eventually I'll try them all, but I use one until it's gone. Maybe I'll begin alternating..",5,2018-01-15 04:00:00+00:00,70701905
False,Not bad,Travel Bag,I like it because it is easy when I go to the gym but the moisture bleeds through a bit and gets soap on the rest of my stuff. Not much though so I am still a fan. One issue I have is I am unable to find a square soap container so I kind of have to use this. If they sold one of those I would def. buy it.,3,2018-01-17 04:00:00+00:00,543921815
True,Big Fan,Cool Fresh Aloe,"I am a big fan of this one, I have dry skin so this has helped me stay moisturized. My wife likes the smell which is obviously a plus.",5,2018-01-17 04:00:00+00:00,70699856
False,Different,Spearmint Basil,This bar is different. It has a unique smell unlike any other bar of soap I've ever smelled. The spearmint is very slight and gets overpowered by the basil resulting in a scent reminiscent of dill pickles. I was expecting a scent that was totally different from what I actually got. Not bad though! The lather was great as per usual.,4,2018-01-19 04:00:00+00:00,70701388
True,Invigorating,Nautical Sage,"Great soap. Currently using Nautical Sage. Cleans so well I can shower 4 times a week instead of 7. Try it out you will notice a difference. Ordered all 10 scents, adding variety to the experience.",5,2018-01-19 04:00:00+00:00,112874164
False,Can't Review What I Haven't Received,Pine Tar,"I ordered the Pine Tar soap in December and was excited to try it as it had many good reviews. However on receiving my order, I found the incorrect soap had been shipped. Mistakes happen, so I contacted the company which said they would ship the correct Pine Tar scent and that I could keep the 2 bars of incorrectly shipped soap. I thought, ""That's great service"". That was a month ago. I am still waiting for the correct soap and the tracking number that I was told would be sent. Now I'm thinking, ""That's NOT great service.""",1,2018-01-21 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,A 2-edged sword...,Eucalyptus Yogurt,"This bar smells AWESOME because of the eucalyptus. It's a strong scent that fills the entire bathroom. It's so strong that it will help open your sinuses! I love it! Unfortunately, eucalyptus does have a downside. It can be harsh on the skin. I felt a bit dry and tight after a few days of using this bar. Other than that it's great. I'd definitely recommend this bar but beware if you have a problem with dry skin.",4,2018-01-23 04:00:00+00:00,70700416
True,Awesome Soap,Pine Tar,"I have tried them all. I have been looking for THIS SOAP! I was skeptical at paying 7 bucks for a bar of soap; WORTH EVERY PENNY. I got my soap yesterday and took my first shower with it this morning. I rubbed the soap on a clean wash cloth, only took a little, and it was plenty to wash my entire body. It smells great, feels great, and I have no words for how I feel after. Even an hour later at my desk, my skin feels clean, soft an hydrated. This is amazing. I used the Pine tar, can't wait to try the other two. Awesome product guys, it's the best soap I've ever used. It looks like it will last a good long time too. I'll update later when I finish this bar.",5,2018-01-23 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

True,Worth Every Penny,Conditioner,Dr squatch's body soap always left me feeling super clean and ready for the day so I had to try the hair products.

I will definitely keep purchasing this product as I have just ordered two more bottles.,5,2018-01-25 04:00:00+00:00,83122952
False,Nice but expensive - here's an alternative,Bay Rum,"There's no doubt the soaps being sold by this company are great and good for you, the issue is cost.

False,One of my favorites,Deep Sea Goats Milk,This is a great alternative to other soaps. It smells like most other soap on the market. It lathers well and rinses away clean though.

False,Mine Was Split When It Arrived,Soap Saver,"I see my last review 'disappeared'... I ordered one and when it arrived it had a minor split. It is now in two halves and in the trash.

True,I've been Squatched!,Cedar Citrus,"I've been on the fence about buying a $7 bar of soap for a few months. I'm not fru-fru kind of man and my poor mind couldn't justify the price. Well, it was the free shipping coupon that got me. I've just taken my first shower with Cedar Citrus. You got me! It smells clean and wonderful, but my skin hasn't felt this great in decades! As a typical vain middle-aged American, I've spent for the skin care creams and kits. I justified that by high-tech formulas that will turn back the hands of time. They work, but not worth the money in my opinion. This bar of soap has made my skin very clean and smooth as a baby. 
A few months ago, I emailed and asked for a small assortment of different soaps in a cheap sampler pack, something like the hotel sample bars. It was a matter of time before I would buy a natural soap (because I like your marketing material). I'm glad I bought it! I feel great and it is worth the money and then some.",5,2018-02-07 04:00:00+00:00,70701577
False,Make it last,Spearmint Basil,"Just want to leave a tip on how you might extend the life of your soap. Call it diminishing returns, has to do with how much lather do we need and at what point your not going to get any cleaner with more lather. You need X amount of lather to get clean, after that your just wasting soap. Try lessoning the amount of lather, use a wash cloth, and do not let it get and/or stay wet and you should see an improvement in the life of your soap. Amen p.s. mine last about 6 weeks. Also one of the tips the good Dr. Left in one of his newsletters on attracting the ladies is to shower less and not wash awash the pheromones.",5,2018-02-08 04:00:00+00:00,70701388

True,I was skeptical.,Bay Rum,"I had always used liquid soap because I didn’t like the way bar soap made my skin feel. However, without mentioning brand names, I recently purchased some bar soap solely based on the sandalwood and cedar scents. The soap boasted about being natural and gluten free. The gluten free soap confused me. But then people started eating tide pods and I understood. 

Anyway. I still got the dry skin feeling. So I purchased the cedar citrus from dr squatch. And I’m writing this review not 5 minutes after I got out of the shower. I am pleased with the product. And will be trying more of their scents. The price is low enough to where it’s worth a shot. I am leaving a review of 4 stars.

I had previously tried Dukes Large bar but it was just too enormous to hold in the shower. Similarly, Dr. Squatch, with its square bars, is difficult to grasp. I do not have large hands and cannot palm a basketball but found the square bar just too hard to hold onto. Additionally, the bar did not even last one week which is customarily my idea of a worthwhile soap bar purchase. I can easily get a week out of Dove for Men and that bar is easy to grasp.

True,The only soap you should use.,Dr. Squatch Favorites Pack,"This is how god intended men to smell. At first when I got this delivery, I was a little wary. The soaps didn’t smell like they were too strong, and that put me off. After using them in the shower though, that’s when it all started. I felt my face twitch, and contort. I stumbled out of the shower to view myself in the mirror, and I had a full Viking beard! I was amazed! I had shaved the night before, so there’s no way this should be possible? I then felt a sudden surge of power, and I jumped though my roof and flew to the nearest forest like super man. When I found myself in the forest, I then realized that I had spontaneously devolved an 8 pack, and a thick coat of manly, good smelling body hair. All the animals in the forest came to hang out, I cracked open a beer with Bigfoot, and then I came home to write this review.

False,"Bay Rum bar soap is in fact, unscented.",Soapscription - 6 Bars per Quarter,"Last month I returned 6 bars of Squatch soap because I had ordered six bars of Bay Rum, but received two bars of Bay Rum and four other miscellaneous bars. I returned the two 'Bay Rum' bars because they had no scent at all. 
 
Those six bars were replaced with six bars labeled 'Bay Rum', and I thought that the situation had been resolved; that these six bars would have the Bay Rum scent of the two bars I originally purchased. 
 While I was using those two(original) bars the Bay Rum scent filled the dressing room/shower area, and I looked forward to the morning shower. 
I've tried each of the six replacement bars; a different one every day expecting that maybe one of the six might have the Bay Rum scent, but none did. There was almost no scent, except for an oily scent of other ingredients.

I don't know if I'll use these bars or just toss them in the garbage, but I'm disappointed enough that I certainly won't be ordering any more soap from Squatch. I thought I had found the right bar soap, but I was wrong.",1,2018-04-13 04:00:00+00:00,270519234

True,Smelling Great & Super Clean!,Deep Sea Goats Milk,"My review is unpaid and literally only the second time in my life I've given a review - the Deep Sea Goat's Milk Soap is JUST that good. So good, I had to write a review on it!! First, thing that hits you is the scent - masculine, not overpowering, smooooooth. And, though the description of it says the scent is mild - it's a strong (again not overpowering) scent -that lasts! I've gotten so many compliments on it from my friends and from the guys at the gym after I shower (weird, but cool) - it's my must-go-to soap on my nights out. After using it, you feel like you have this micro layer of of nourishing oil..then, you rinse and the big surprise comes - you SQUEAK!! Literally, my skin felt squeaky clean. So, I figured being squeaky clean equals all the Deep Sea Goat's Milk washed off. Not so! My skin stayed nourished that my normal routine of slathering on lotion after the shower has decreased. I mean, I still do it but, without the slathering. Now, for the surprise that I didn't expect. EVERY SINGLE product, including unscented products, my cats shy away from. Yes, I'm a manly man with cats, leave it alone. This product is soooo natural that my cats did NOT shy away or turn their face when they came up to me to pet them, RIGHT after I got finished using the soap. Aaaaamazing.

 Overall, I was not very impressed with the soaps I've sampled so far, for the following reasons:
 1) The soapholder, after being in contact with the used bar of soap, created an unbreakable bond. Despite my efforts to separate them, I ended up chucking both in the trash.
 2) I was expecting a strong odor, both from the soap and after using it on my skin, but the smell was anything but bold. My sense of smell is just fine, thank you.

False,I want to love this,Shave Bar,"Let me start by saying I am on soapscription and all I use to wash my body is Dr. Squatch. I love love love their soap. I also love wet shaving, have been doing it for years and have tried many different soaps from various companies.
I unfortunately do not love this soap. The ingredient list including bentonite clay, the scent, and the slickness are all great, but the soap just does not lather properly. I'm surprised to see other reviews saying it does and I have to assume that the recent recipe or batch that I've received two tins from are somehow different.
After writing Dr. Squatch detailing my issues with my first purchase, their awesome customer service provided me with a second tin to try, but it also had the same: an extremely foamy and airy lather that dissolved & dissipated on the face quickly. I've shaved 6 times with the soap now and have let the soap bloom and tried working the lather for several minutes. I tried face lathering, hand lathering, scuttle lathering and even applying the puck directly to my face. The last method works to apply a thick paste to my face which seems like it's working, but with the slightest introduction of water there comes that airy foam that dissolves before you finish a pass.
I've tried very hard to get this soap to work for me but just have to give up at this point. I hope the doctor fixes the recipe.",2,2018-05-01 04:00:00+00:00,83120728

I was wondering if there was anywhere’s nearby to purchase Dr. Squatch products. After sending an email I immediately received a response listing the nearest locations carrying their product. A second experience involves my most recent order of the Ultimate Bundle. After placing it I had questions about pricing/shipping all the way to Nova Scotia, Canada. I sent an email off and received a reply almost instantly which resulted in the resolution of the issue entirely.

True,Amazing shampoo and conditioner!,Hair Care Kit,"First off I was skeptical about spending $30 on shampoo and conditioner, but I had already tried their bar soaps so I figured I'd give it a try. Boy was I glad I did! First of all I had always washed my hair everyday with just normal 2 in 1 shampoo and my hair has always been thin and delicate. But now after a few months of using these products and washing my hair only 2-3 times per week but using the conditioner everyday my hair has transformed! It is now way thicker and stronger and it seems to even grow much faster now. Also the shampoo smells freaking amazing as well as the conditioner. I love the tingly feeling the conditioner gives after letting it sit for a min or two. Anyways i highly suggest you try this and pair it with the bar soaps(pine tar is my favorite). Your hair and skin will be thanking you, trust me.",5,2018-05-25 04:00:00+00:00,503651566

True,Great Soap,Pine Tar,"So I’ve used many different brands of pine tar soap. I use it for tattoo healing, for my face, for my scalp and beard, and usually once a week in my whole body. I tried Dr. Squatch pine tar when the normal brand I buy was out of stock and hadn’t been refilled in stock for a while (this happens at times with hand made soaps). I read some reviews and purchased Dr. Squatch and I’ve got to say this is some of the best soap I’ve ever used. The scent is awesome and the sand grit is great for exfoliating and leaves you feeling clean and your skin tingly. People have talked about the soap not lasting, a helpful hint is to cut the bar down into smaller sections and use up a section at a time. This helps the soap to last longer and the bars are more manageable. Either way, the soap lasts just as long as other brands I’ve used. But for the soap...I’m a believer and Dr. Squatch is my brand! I’m going to stick with them and try out some of the other scents. Just an FYI...my teenage daughters use the pine tar soap on their faces and the results are better than the harsh chemical facial washes you can buy. They wash with the pine tar soap and then use Thayers Witch Hazel with Lavender. They’ve had great success and enjoy the scent as much as I do. You CANNOT go wrong with this soap. If you don’t like it you’re honestly just nit picking and probably don’t like anything 100%. I’m going to buy this as gifts for other family members wanting a natural hand made bar. Can’t say enough good about it. Thanks Dr. Squatch!!!!",5,2018-05-26 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

True,The soap that saved my sack!!!!,Soapscription - 6 Bars per Quarter,"This soap is amazing, I’ve never really treated shower as something I’d pay real attention too, you know hop in, soap up, rinse off, and hop out. That’s pretty much the routine I always used, not really paying any mind to what scent or soap I would use. At times a lot of those soaps would dry my skin out or because of the additives would make my skin break out, even give me rashes in places they don’t need to be. Then randomly I saw your add and thought why not, maybe this soap will live up to the promise of saving my sack, so I placed my order, all while laughing at the Dr. Squatch commercial I just saw. Waited a few days and then boom order came in. Never had I been so excited to see this soap, or any soap for that matter. After using it for over a week now I have to say this soap truly is everything it says it is. There’s no strong soap smell but yet a pleasant aroma that sticks around with you, not overbearing, just present enough to keep you fresh throughout the day. Adding in that my skin is feeling way more hydrated, healthy, and nourished. No additives so no more random rashes. This soap truly is a soap to save your sack!!!",5,2018-06-11 04:00:00+00:00,270519234

As an adult I’ve been able to keep it under much better control but have always had dry skin and trouble finding a body soap that didn’t make it worse, until now. Dr. Squatch has found the secret recipe and once you’ve had it you can’t go back. Not only is it great for your skin and all natural, but the scents are both wonderful AND manly, not an easy to achieve combo (I especially like golden moss and pine tar). If any man needs a good soap, I would highly recommend Dr. Squatch, just as I’ve already recommended it to all of my friends. Thank you and keep up the good work!

False,Favorite Soap ... So Far,Cedar Citrus,"Cedar Citrus was my first soap that I used from Dr. Squatch. It smelled like I had just rolled around in oranges that had spent a week in my cedar closet. I had been plagued with itchy dry skin for years. In three showers, that was gone. The soap lasted for 2.5 weeks lathering liberally on a washcloth with the water off and using the soap saver. The brief duration of the soap is actually nice, because I found I was starting to get nose-blind to the scent around the 2 week mark. 

I will definitely be starting a Soapscription with this bar at the top of my list.

My only two complaints: 
1. The travel bag is out of stock. I'd love to take Dr. Squatch with me on my upcoming vacations. Putting it in a plastic baggy will keep unnecessary moisture on the soap, thus drastically shortening its life.
2. I don't get to try out the Sudsfaction Guarantee, because this is, in fact, the best soap I have ever used.",5,2018-06-18 04:00:00+00:00,70701577
True,It is indeed worth it.,Hair Care Kit,"For as long as I can remember, I have been battling dry, itchy scalp. I bought the big, cheap 2-in-1 dandruff shampoo and conditioner from a local warehouse (let the reader understand). As a man who wears a black shirt with a white collar everyday, it was always embarrassing how many white flakes were on my shoulders. After a week of using these products (shampooing on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays; conditioning everyday), the dryness and itchiness have both almost subsided. My shoulders also reflect this change. My scalp and hair have begun to adjust to the new regiment. My wife also appreciates how soft this makes my beard feel.
What's more, this stuff smells amazing and feels even better on the scalp.
Dr. Squatch, you have two shelves in my shower (one for soap, another for shampoo and conditioner) for as long as I can afford you and you remain in business.",5,2018-06-18 04:00:00+00:00,503651566

Out of the shower it keeps that feeling.I can't brush it, I can't comb it, I cant braid it without breakage. over all just a bad experience.

I took this bar with me because it has some incredible exfoliation, and trust me, after walking for miles through the forest, you want something that can get the sweat and grime out. Not to mention it works great for hair too so you can travel light. I also didn't feel too bad about washing in the river, as I would with a store bought soap, since this soap is natural. There's nothing like bathing in a river, filtered by the trees of a rainforest, while hearing howler monkeys in the trees beside you.

My main issue, however, is that my hair doesn't feel as good with this shampoo + conditioner as it does with other quality shampoos you can pick up at CVS. It's only been 1.5 weeks of use, so maybe my opinion will shift. Or maybe my expectations were too high. I really thought I'd say, ""Wow.

False,Overall I'm impressed,The King's Ransom,"After using the products for a little while I am very impressed. The soaps are excellent quality and suds up well even on the first use. Pine tar cleans incredibly well and leaves my skin feeling super clean. Bay rum is also nice. I'm a heavy equipment mechanic and I get pretty dirty. I have thick straight hair and I know the shampoo says to only use it 2-3 times a week, and to use the conditioner as a daily cleaner, but it doesn't clean my hair very well on it own. Use them both every day and my hair feels clean and healthy. As for the cologne, definitely not for me or my girlfriend. It's a bit oily and smells like you'd imgaine a Hemlock trail to smell like..",5,2018-08-10 04:00:00+00:00,1469824140

False,Not worth the price,Pine Tar,"I usually like boutique soaps, but this soap is really not worth the money. First, the bars are super small, and while they do lather up nicely, they won't last long. Second, the fragrance is only superficial at best. It smells like whatever fragrance it is when you use it the first few times, but not only does the fragrance not linger on your skin afterwards, but the fragrance eventually turns into more of a soapy/toilet bowl cleaner smell after several uses of the soap bar (think Ajax after you've swirled it in your toilet bowl a few times). And, at least where the Pine Tar soap is concerned, that ""exfoliating and nourishing oatmeal"" feels more like scraping your skin with gravel than something good for you. Buy at your own risk. Seems like these manly boutique soaps have popped up everywhere lately. Save your money and find a good smelling cleansing soap elsewhere.",1,2018-08-10 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

True,Gold Moss,Gold Moss,"First time user of Squatch soap. Definitely worth it. The Gold Moss scent is fantastic and does have staying power, usually can still smell the scent on me about halfway through my workday (which includes field work outside in the hot and muggy summer of Maryland). I suffer from dry skin with most bar soaps; so far no issue at all with Gold Moss after a month of use, if anything, it’s been hydrating as advertised. Finally, I’ve seen the reviews of the bar not lasting...all I can say is I shower daily and after a month of use, still probably have a week left of my first bar.

False,Very Unique experience,Pine Tar,"My first experience with your soap came with the Bay Rum bar and it was not a very good one. It snapped in half after 3 uses and then crumbled when I tried to fuse them together. It was bad and I just threw it away. The scent was nice, but I was afraid to use the other 5 bars of soap I purchased, but the Pine Tar was very interesting. At first I was not ready for the sandpaper like feel at first and on my face after shaving it was not fun. So the first day, I was questioning the logic of such a bar. I never exfoliated before I guess, so this was something I was not prepared for. The second day, the rough exterior of the bar lessened a tad or I just got used to it, and I discovered that I rather enjoyed the feel of it. The more I used it, the more I enjoyed the texture and scent. The only issue I had was that it melted in the final stage, but it is way better than breaking into tiny little pieces. Tomorrow I will try the Aloe or Spearmint one, not sure yet, but I am looking forward to another unique experience.",4,2018-08-13 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

Before using the shampoo and conditioner from Dr. Squatch, my scalp and the skin around my ears were always dry and itchy. I assume it was from the harsh shampoo I used to try and treat what I thought was dandruff. After using these two Squatch products, in just two weeks, I noticed that have not seen dry skin around my ears and my scalp has not itched much at all compared to how it was before. I’m truly impressed. They also smell great. I would recommend these products to any guy. Also, I followed the advice on the bottle and the website and only shampoo maybe 1-2 times a week and use the conditioner the other days. I believe that has helped as well.",5,2018-08-17 04:00:00+00:00,503651566

When I got out of the shower and dressed I came out to the living room where my wife was and she said she could smell me showering at rhe other end of the house. She then locked lips and I knew I made the right choice. Dont have to tell you how the rest of my night went. The next morning i got up and I feel amazing.

True,"DUDE, this is the BEST",Shave Bar,"Bro this is the best shave soap. I am in the US Army and I shave every single day. Let me tell you. For the first 14.5 years in service, I used the shave gel and razors with a billion blades on it and dealt with razor burn, pimples and constant ingrown hairs along my neck and under the kin from the chin strap. It also cost a ton of money. I decided to switch to just a safety razor and shave soap from Van Der Hagen. Pimples stopped skin felt better with no razor burn, but got lots of cuts learning a new shave method. When I saw your guys commercial on face creep, I laughed at it and was like awesome telling the truth about today's soap. But then I thought, what these dudes are on to something because I always have dry skin and still get the ingrown hairs. So I dived in and got a bar of your Cedar Citrus and shave soap. Gents after only showering for a week and shaving with your soap, my skin feels great and my face is smooth and clear. I wake up and can't wait to shave before going to physical fitness and then can't wait to get in the shower to smell the soap. So refreshing. Yes itdoes sound like I am in love with your soap. I may be. Any hoot. Keep up the great work. You have a customer for life.

Thanks Dr. Squatch!,5,2018-10-14 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,One of my top 3 favorites!,Crisp IPA,"Love the IPA! It has made it into my personal rotation of Pine Tar and Bay Rum. It has a really refreshing citrus undertone, grapefruit that is still earthy.. loving my showers!!",5,2018-10-23 04:00:00+00:00,1802804246
False,Am I doing something wrong!?,Pine Tar,"I received the 3 soap sample pack with the wooden soap dish (which smells awesome by the way) on Monday of this week. I tried the pine tar first because I think I liked that one the best. I read a previous review where a guys soap cracked and fell apart, and he was told to put it somewhere in the shower where it could get water on it and not dry out. Thats what I did with mine (I put it in the shower spot assigned to my stuff due to my wife and her two daughters over abundance of shower supplies). Having said that, I think all the females in the house taking showers are too much for the soap to handle, because it is now 1/4 of the size it was, and today is only Thursday. I don’t know if all the girls showering is too much water for it to handle or not, but I put it Behind the shower curtain this morning, so hopefully it’ll do better with not so much water on it. If it weren’t for that, I would give it a 5 star rating because I love it!! But I can’t be sure it’s entirely the girls’ fault. If getting it away from the women’s overspray fixes the problem, I will come back and update my review to 5 stars, and let all the Squatches out there know to keep it away from a household of women’s shower spray. Hahaha But for real, thanks for the product guys...it’s truly terrific!!",4,2018-10-25 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

False,Not impressed. Especially for the price,Soap Saver,Ordered my soap saver with my very first subscription. I love the soaps. Hate the saver. After a few showers it started to produce some sort of stain that dropped down the shower walls. The one day I picked up the soap and it stuck to the saver which dropped to the floor of the shower and broke into pieces. Not worth the money. But still a happy customer with the soaps.,1,2018-11-02 04:00:00+00:00,70698419

True,Crisp IPA is amazing!!,Crisp IPA,"What can I say besides this new scent is magnificent! My favorite Squatch scents are Bay Rum and Gold Moss Scrub. This new Crisp IPA goes right in that same category with its delicious scent. I may just take a bite out of this bar for dinner or perhaps I'll order an IPA to go along with my steak. The point im trying to make is that you will love this new scent. If you're a Squatch fan, you're in for a real treat. So sit back and enjoy a tall glass of heaven while smelling like you just walked out of a tropical paradise! Sincerely a Squatchaholic!!",5,2018-11-06 04:00:00+00:00,1802804246

True,Highly recommend,Soap Saver,"I purchased 2 soap savers. 1 for the shower, one for the sink. They work wonderfully in both locations. Not only does the soap dry quickly, but the saver does as well. There is no issue with the soap sticking or sliding off. Biggest plus, it absolutely makes a huge difference in how long the soap lasts. Well worth every cent.",5,2018-11-13 04:00:00+00:00,70698419
False,"Great, original and manly smelling!",Pine Tar,"I guess you could say I pretty manly. I love pretty women, shooting guns at the range or a good patient hunt, and I enjoy driving my big, old gas guzzling pickup truck to do manly pickup truck stuff in, but ‘alas I have fought terribly with a condition known as folliclitis which causes my skin to be extremely sensitive to heat, friction, most harsh fragrance chemicals, and so I have had to spend more money on better soaps, which I always loved irish spring or dove men products. But eventually I had to stop using fragranced soaps at all, so currently I’ve been using Dove Sensitive Skin. 
 Recently my Dad gifted me a bar of Dr.Squatch Pine Tar soap. I was absolutely fascinated by the shape, solidity and the natural, overwhelmingly manly scent, and albeit I have to use it easily and with a soft squidgee I absolutely think this brand is great, and has carved their perfect little nitch in the heart of every manly man that uses it! 
 I really can’t wait to try to Citrus bar soap next, but as a suggestion, and not sure if any other men have requested it as well, but maybe try releasing a bar soap that is specific for us men with the more sensitive end of the spectrum skin wise, but overall from one man to another, two thumbs up, great job and keep on squatch’n with your bad selves.",4,2018-11-13 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

False,Amazing,Crisp IPA,"This is my new favorite scent. I love it. It smells amazing just like an IPA. My only problem was the bar was falling apart on one end before I opened the box.

True,This is not the “OTHERS”,Fresh Fir,"Wow! This stuff is ABSOLUTELY the best out there! I’ve used many other very expensive beard oils. Some were over $45 for a small bottle.

False,Cologne,Beechwood Bourbon,I was so statisfied with the soap I had to try the cologne. When I recieved it I got excited and couldn't waite to try it. When i opened the bottle there was no scent. So I put some on and for a brief second there was a faint fragrance. I can't tell you how disappointed I am.,1,2018-11-19 04:00:00+00:00,70704176
True,A Happy Accident,Crushed Pine,"I was very excited to receive my order of the beechwood bourbon cologne in the mail. When I opened the package I was, at first, disappointed to see the crushed pine in the package. My disappointment quickly faded the moment I cracked the seal of that bottle. I contacted customer service about the issue and they apologized and offered to correct the order. They responded to my email very quickly and were helpful. I declined the offer and they were okay with that. The customer service was exceptional, the cologne and soaps are worth every penny. I've noticed a real difference in my skin since I began using Dr. Squatch. I love it when there is a good product out there that's reasonably priced and the company behind it are good people. That's a rare combination today",5,2018-11-21 04:00:00+00:00,86211176
False,Not impressed but my girlfriend was,Pine Tar,The bars of soap lasted a week long so I was pretty disappointed. It smelled and felt great but definitely not enough bang for your buck. My girlfriend on the other hand was impressed. She loves using it as a moisturizer for shaving. She says it’s the absolute best soap she’s ever used for that. So the bars we have left that’s what they are being used for.,2,2018-11-24 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Favorite so far,Pine Tar,"The grit they put in there is perfectly what I was looking for. Some people say it’s “to abrasive” but I work in a weld shop and I don’t have sensitive skin. Works amazing to get tebdirt and grime from work off and the dead or peeling skin after arc burn starts peeling. 

Love the smell, works better than any soap I’ve ever used, will be keeping my subscription, just a couple I’m interested in trying yet but so far this is my favorite.",5,2018-11-24 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
True,Great product,Pine Tar,Decided to try out after i saw the commercial. Ordered two bars to try out before i soapscribed pine tar and eucalyptus yogurt both great scents cant wait to try some of the others out. My 8 year old son love this soap as well.

False,A joke,Pine Tar,Waited for days and never even got a tracking number. I placed an order and they just basically ignored it. They load up yr email w/ tons of the same emails trying to get u to buy more and sell your info so 20+ other companies send you emails daily too. Wish I never even bothered w/ this company!

False,Great smell and refreshing lather but....,Bay Rum,"I have used various liquid soaps for many years, saw the Dr Squatch commercial was hooked and gave it a try. Great scent, felt very refreshed after use but one bar only lasted 10 days. With that much consumption and an $8 price tag I’m feeling a bit disappointed..

False,Brings Out the Manly Yooper in Me,Pine Tar,"Being from Michigan, I love how this embodies the scent of the great northern outdoors. Not to mention how it doesn't dry my skin out like my old stuff would so it's just about perfect.

False,Smell 1/10,Pine Tar,Smells like Lysol but as far as using it it’s not bad. The exfoliation is a bit rough but the smell is very shitty so 1 out of ten seems very fair.,2,2018-12-20 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,Smell 3/10,Cedar Citrus,So as far as smell this soap is true to the name definitely smells woodsy but not in the best way and you can barely smell any citrus .

False,Love it...but,Soap Saver,"Love this soap saver! It will save your soap’s life by weeks! But contrary to the description, it does still stick, after every use.

False,I love this scent!,Pine Tar,"I have been resistant to subscriptions. I ordered a variety of Dr. Squatch soaps to try them out. When I opened the mailbox, the scent blasted out at me, and it was mostly the pine tar. I thought that it might be too strong, but it rapidly became my favorite. I ordered more on specials, then started a subscription. I recently suspended my subscription, not because I don’t like the products, but because with all of my ordering I have over 30 bars +one in the shower. Nearly half of those are pine tar.

False,"Permanent user, now!!",Pine Tar,"I've been impatiently waiting for my order until today, and I was ecstatic to get it. So despite already being clean I decided to hop in the shower, and it's like I just met a sexy mountain troll, and she and I decided to make a test tube baby with a pine tree. This soap is phenomenal, I feel incredibly clean, the exfoliation feels.. Indescribable. I can't accurately word how much this product has impressed me. 10/5 stars.

False,Best.Soap.Ever....duh,Cedar Citrus,"I'm a Bearding guy that uses Citrusy scents. So when I finally tried your CITRUS bar.... I was BLOWN..AWAY! Yanno. I spend more money on BodyWash! Than I did this... Just because bodywash is expensive and it DRIES my skin out! WHY! Makes me look bad, smell bad, itchy, I probably look like a crack head.... nah. 
It took a month to go through the full bar. I realize u shoulda got the Monthly so I didnt have to REORDER now. (Kicks self in ass)But, some of your scents I've been around due to beard care. There is ANOTHER ONE...right above it I think.. that I'm interested in that I got too. The CLOVE! I'm really into CLOVE scent, so is my woman. This should last me awhile. I wish I had the extra cash to get the wooden grip for the bar of soap. Mine are always slipping off and getting SLAMMED on the floor or on my feet. But, December hit the wallet pretty hard, yanno? 

But, for all you fellow BEARDOS, Listen up. Of you use Citrus in your beard, THIS IS THE PERFECT SOAP FOR YOU. No doubt. and yes, to answer your question, you do smell good throughout the day.

False,Hits a Homerun,Pine Tar,This soap is the major leagues of natural soap. A fresh smell and clean feeling that lasts into the extra innings.

False,"5 star product, 3 star lifespan",Pine Tar,"Bought Pine Tar. I loved what it did to my skin. I didn't even mind the very obvious...scratchiness. My skin was no longer horribly dry after just 1 shower, though. I normally have to moisturize after showers due to horrible dry skin in the winter. It's not necessary when I use Dr. Squatch Pine Tar soap. That being said, I'll be lucky to get 5 showers out of 1 bar, which is ridiculous at $7 a bar, $9 for the total initial purchase cost. I did purchase a soapscription with the hope that this is uncommon. I'll be getting two bars soon, so we'll see how long they last. Question for other verified purchasers--does the $15 soap block actually help with this problem? It seems ridiculous to buy it without that knowledge, and unless it's going to at least double the lifespan of the bars, I won't be purchasing it.

I haven't had any issues with the bar falling apart like one of the reviews mentioned, I keep them on a soap saver in the shower. Another review stated the scents are overpowering or chemical smelling, on the contrary, I wish the scent had MORE staying power, obviously it's strongest just after use, I'd LOVE if this smell came in a body lotion, or beard product. None of the bars I ordered smelled anything other than natural & clean & DEAD SEXY!! Do yourself (& us ladies) a favor, sac up, and try it!! You won't be sorry.

False,Goes The Distance,Ulitmate Bundle,"Prior to this box I had only bought a bar of the Pine Tar in the past. Thoroughly impressed, I decided to see if there were other scents that came close to how great it was but didn't know where to start.

Each bar lasted longer than I had expected (and lathered more than expected too!). I wanted to test each scent before submitting a review, so it ended up taking quite a while. Very satisfied with the purchase. Will continue to Squatch it up.

False,It's great,Nautical Sage,I had a opportunity to try it and I was amazed it smells just like an ocean breeze and you can tell it takes a lot of time and effort to make one of these Bars of soap some people may not be able to afford it but it is well worth the money but now I will get on to the pros and cons the pros 1 it's not dry now 2 it is not made with harsh chemicals 3 the scent sticks with you but is not overpowering cons 1 it does not last long only for about 2 or 3 weeks beyond that I see nothing else wrong with it I hope my review has inspired you to at least give it a chance,5,2019-03-05 04:00:00+00:00,112874164

It is great and the smell is great. My bathroom smells amazing also! When the box came in the mail you could smell the soap through the box!

False,Not for straight razor shaving,Shave Bar,"I tried this soap recently and agree with reviews I have seen on other shaving forums. It's a nice soap but it just doesn't lather enough for straight razor shaving. 
I contacted Dr. Squatch and told them my experience with it and they refunded my money right away. This is a great company.",4,2019-03-08 04:00:00+00:00,83120728
False,The Real Deal,Pine Tar,"When a company makes a scented product, and bills that scent as ""manly,"" and then names it something like ""pine tar,"" then as a man, I expect it to smell precisely as such, without any nonsense. Dr Squatch, you do not disappoint! The pine tar smells like pine tar, the crisp IPA smells like crisp IPA, the snozberries taste like snozberries! I was a bit worried because I first tried a different company, similar to yours, that also billed their fragrances as manly, and gave their products manly names, only for it to all come out of the box smelling like some horrible potpourri concoction. Not manly. You on the other hand, make an amazing product that gets me clean, and leaves my skin feeling good and smelling great for hours after use.",5,2019-03-09 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,Smells good,Bay Rum,Best smelling scent I’ve tried so far would have giving more stars but bar of soap was only 3/4 there when I opened the package. could clearly see it had broke and about a 1/4 if the bar didn’t make it into the box disappointing cuz it does go fast even faster when you start with less then a full bar,3,2019-03-09 04:00:00+00:00,70700670

False,The feeling of Zen,Spearmint Basil,"This soap is absolutely amazing, I just got a soapscription and I was extremely excited when I got my first box of soap from you guys. It's the first time I'm actually using soap that doesn't have harsh chemicals or that wasn't one of the popular brands and let me tell you there is definitely a difference. I'm more excited to take a shower now and I was before. After the shower I feel a lot more relaxed and my skin seems a lot more rejuvenated than ever before, I came to the conclusion that I'm extremely sensitive the chemicals of all kinds and that's universal when it comes to my body recently very particular when I consume I comes to food and what I use to take care of my body when it comes to hygiene this soap company has definitely help me achieve this when it comes to going all natural. Thank you Dr.squatch",5,2019-03-11 04:00:00+00:00,70701388
False,I Wanted More...,Pine Tar,"I have a few good things to say and a few bad things to say, but I won't demand a refund because I'm a good sport and I tried something and it wasn't exactly what I wanted. Big deal.

First the bad:

Maybe this is just soap itself with my skin, or maybe I need something lotion based because my skin always feels rather dry or tacky when I used the soap. I've used not only the bar, but a lather builder and a loofah to exfoliate to no avail with this bar of soap (I did not attempt any other bar while using this one.) Secondly, the scent is not an all day thing, actually it's not even a morning thing, if you were expecting that from the ""ultramasculine"" yet funny commercial you'll likely be disappointed. Also, the pine tar oil is so present that it will literally drip down your shower wall when it's wet.


The good news:

The soap smells absolutely fantastic. It's an incredibly delightful experience while in use, builds lather instantly and lasts with a lather builder for an entire shower with minimal application (something not always common in organic soaps as they tend to fall apart, so I'll say that's just a sign this is a good quality product.) 

Summary:

I've not written off Dr Squatch yet, I'll continue to use it till it's gone, and maybe I'll try a different bar, but if I could get a suggestion for a bar leaving my skin feeling less dried out or Squatch comes out with a moisturizer then I'm game for more because I really did like the the scent, quality of the bar, and the overall (more) organic structure of it as a product.",3,2019-03-11 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,Best soap ever,Cool Fresh Aloe,This is the best soap I’ve tried. In my opinion it moisturizing better than dove. This soap also smells amazing. I also feel very clean,5,2019-03-12 04:00:00+00:00,70699856
False,Beechwood bourbon,Beechwood Bourbon,"Smells amazing! Doesnt seem to last long though, maybe I didn't apply enough? Make this into a body spary and I'll never buy another cologne again!",3,2019-03-13 04:00:00+00:00,70704176

False,Great For Skin but Not Great Value,Pine Tar,"Even with a dry, elevated soap dish I can't get a week's worth of showers out of one bar without half-assing 2-3 lathers. I'm not spending $15 for a little block of wood and I seriously doubt it would make it last any longer than the soap dish does. Cut the cost or make bigger bars for the same price. Hell, or they could offer a 4 bars a month subscription for $20 and I'd probably keep my subscription.",3,2019-03-14 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,Good soap.,Pine Tar,Pine Tar is pretty good but it has the distinct smell of the powdered bathroom cleaner “Comet.” The exfoliation is a bit rough for me without using a rag or scrubber.,4,2019-03-15 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,Not worth it at all,Pine Tar,I tried this bar along with several others and I'm not impressed the oatmeal in the bar which is to exfoliate feels more like bits of pinecone and not in a good way at all. Its extremely rough and actually cut me in a few spots nothing major but certainly not desired. Also after using it about three times the bar is almost gone. Complete RIP off.,1,2019-03-17 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,Gave me hives,Cedar Citrus,I tried this bar it smells good but it isn't really noticable post shower and I felt absolutely no exfoliating at all and it actually gave me hives on my arm I tried it several times and got hives two of the times. Also just like the pine tar 2-3 showers and it's almost gone.,1,2019-03-17 04:00:00+00:00,70701577
False,Its just ok,Cool Fresh Aloe,I tried this bar and it worked ok gave me no weird side effects but it also definitely didnt make my skin feel moisturized actually kinda felt more dry after smell is ok but very weak can barely smell it while using and not at all after.

False,My favorite one!,Gold Moss,"I tried the sample pack that included Pine Tar, Cedar Citrus and Gold Moss. Unexpectedly, the Gold Moss is my favorite.

False,Amazing bar of soap,Deep Sea Goats Milk,"Been using Dr. Squatch since Christmas when my wife got it for me. My first bar ever used. Deep sea goats milk. It's amazing!!!! I feel fresh, clean and really combats against dry skin!!!! Love the squatch soaps, but goats milk my favorite for now. Will have to try them all!!!!",5,2019-03-20 04:00:00+00:00,70699496
False,Horrible!,Bay Rum,"Worst soap I've ever used. The smell was the first issue, got both the pine tar and the Bay rum, both smell like detergent with slightly different tones to it. The bay rum smells like a mix of Ajax and Irish Spring. We don't use any heavily scented items in our home, no noxious cleaners, so this soap came across as smelling rather harsh. The smell filled the whole bathroom, my kids were wondering what was going on in there, I had to open the window and put the soaps in baggies, it still took several hours for the smell to dissipate! I still wanted to give the soap a try, if the soap was nice then maybe I could justify trying a different scent. But the soap is way to harsh to be used on skin! It left my skin feeling tight, dry, and itchy, I had to moisturize after showering which I never have to do with my current soap. We use very natural soaps but wanted to move away from plastic, so bar soap would accomplish this nicely, but this bar soap is unusable (well I'm thinking tough jobs like scrubbing out the trash can or maybe the duck's pool, as long as I have gloves on to protect my skin from the soap, this soap could be very useful in those types of applications). If you are used to a mainstream bar soap then this might work for you, but if you are already using a natural soap then I'd say to stear clear. I'll be canceling my subscription and adding this soap to our household cleaners.",1,2019-03-22 04:00:00+00:00,70700670

False,The amazing pine smell!,Crushed Pine,I love the way this smells! It is great and makes me feel like I am meeting up with Sasquatch in a sweet smelling pine forest!

False,Cleaner than i have felt in a long time,Pine Tar,Great soap! Me being a mechanic I need a tough soap Pine Tar works great and I feel cleaner. If Squatch was a mechanic he would use Pine Tar this one will stay on my soapscription thanks for a great product!!,5,2019-03-30 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,Great Soap!!,Pine Tar,Me being a mechanic I need a good scrubbing after a hard work day. Pine Tar is awesome at just that it really scrubs the grime away BUT is not hard on my skin like commercial hand cleaners. And I love the long lasting scent. If Squatch was a mechanic he would use Pine Tar.,5,2019-03-31 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,The Best,Pine Tar,"As soon as I lathered this soap onto my once frail and tiny body, I instantly noticed changes. Overnight I grew 6 inches, seeing these incredible changes, I decided to cover myself in this soap another time. This gave me the energy to sprint 10 miles to the gym, no man could ever catch me. Once I was there I began to hit the weights and I noticed these weights were too light for me. I realized I had been infused with the strength of Squatch.
 I went outside and bench pressed all the vehicles in the parking lot. Once I worked up a good sweat I ran back home and took another shower, guess what was sitting there for me. That’s right, Dr. Squatch Pine Tar, I rubbed this godly bar of soap on my skin and I grew a 10 inch beard, thick enough to stop a bullet. 
 Don’t believe me? Try it for yourself. Unleash your Squatch.",5,2019-03-31 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,Pine Tar is the best thing to lather my......,Pine Tar,"This soap is fantastic! I get compliments of ""you smell amazing"" and it has really been great for my skin. I've been looking for a soap like this and now it's the only kind I buy. I like the bay rum and anything that hasn't worked, Squatch gladly works with me to find a bar that does. I really love the marketing, humor, product and way you all put us in mind. I appreciate it all and lookin forward to continuing my soapscription with you all.",5,2019-04-07 04:00:00+00:00,70702082

False,Pine tar,Pine Tar,"A true review on this from me would be a 4/5 I am a mechanic and I will say It does smell good and the smell stays for a good while 4-5 hours for me. It also gets the grime off decently well. Only problem I had is I shower twice a day before and after work and it only lasted me about a week. I saw reviews with people saying it’s long lasting, I wouldn’t say that personally but if it wasn’t for that I would rate it a 5. But $7 a bar and $2 shipping I definitely won’t be buying one every week but every now and then I don’t mind buying a bar of this.",4,2019-04-10 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,Worth the Money,Pine Tar,"When I took my first cold shower with this bad boy, I fell in love with the scent and the way it moisturized my skin was fantastic. A lot of people complain about the longevity of this soap so I cut it into fourths with some floss and use 1/4 of the bar at a time, this makes it last much longer. I highly recommend this soap to anyone that wants a better smelling and feeling soap.",5,2019-04-13 04:00:00+00:00,70702082
False,"Extends the life, but my soap stuck to mine for a while",Soap Saver,"Over all I'm really happy with the product, but about the first 4 bars of soap I used with the soap saver, the bar would stick to my soap saver.

False,Cedar Citrus,Cedar Citrus,"I bought the soap and love it. I live with a room mate who rarely takes a bath so I had been always bringing my soap back and for to the shower. Then one day I left it in the shower thinking he never takes a bath it will be ok. He used my bar of soap and came out and said it was the best bar of soap he has ever used, and has started taking regular baths with my soap. I can’t use it any more because that’s gross so I’m going to have to buy another one, and protect this one with my life.",5,2019-04-15 04:00:00+00:00,70701577
